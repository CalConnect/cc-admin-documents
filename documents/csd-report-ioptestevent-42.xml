organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.</p>

organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_a345e90e-6700-4c15-a9ac-350b116b2aee">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>
<p id="_644943ba-2cd4-439f-b6d5-a658f4a9a64e">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>
<ul id="_c32fb0d8-1dc7-493a-bf83-4c0c32d5de2c">
<li>
<p id="_40b1ca85-4e1d-48ed-b03a-7fa266591151">Spherical Cow Group</p>

<p id="_279ea9c7-9b06-45d4-88ad-4ae7d352a03e">Jorte</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="_d5bbe8c4-fe09-4aad-89cc-bf1a112311d0">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>
<p id="_c1ca910e-6768-4b96-87ca-82d54b7839c4">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>
<p id="_3087ea6f-e694-411a-a6e7-21909c8e486d">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>
<p id="_873585cf-9609-4ca2-8430-ecc703e2a052">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>
<p id="_50a95f28-d067-4857-864f-3526689650b9">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>
<p id="_0cfcfdcc-e6bc-4019-a4b5-b2e7c7725638">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
