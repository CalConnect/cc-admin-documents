== Introduction

Roundtable XXIII took place on February 1-3, 2012, hosted by Apple in Cupertino, California.
The event was attended by 35 people from 16 organizations. The CalConnect Interoperability Test
Event was held immediately prior to the Roundtable on January 30 - February 1. Twenty-one
people from 8 organizations were present onsite, including representatives from five different
areas in Apple.

The Roundtable was dedicated to technical committee sessions, and informal discussions and
networking, with an all-hands Plenary meeting as the last item on Friday afternoon. The Technical
Committee sessions were as usual organized sequentially, without competing parallel sessions, as
is our standard practice to allow all attendees who wished to be involved in the discussions of each
Technical Committee the opportunity to do so.

== Special Events

Two "implementation" BOFS were held during the Interoperability Test Event on Monday and
Tuesday afternoons:

* Update versus replacement of calendar and contact data
* Auto-discovery and account provisioning

We expect the findings and output from the BOFs to inform future work in CalConnect, either in
the context of one or more existing Technical Committees or in possibly forming new Technical
Committees. The host session was chaired by Wilfredo SÃ¡nchez of Apple, and discussed the
adoption and implementation of open standards in Apple's calendaring products.

== Documents Updated since Last Roundtable

Updated IETF Drafts related to CalConnect (includes updates to published CalConnect
documents):

* http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-webdav-sync
* http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cal-resource-schema
* http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-douglass-timezone-service/

CalConnect has replaced the internal Interoperability Test Event Report with an internal wiki, and
the public Interoperability Test Report with a section on the Test Event in the CalConnect _Minutes_
newsletter publised after each event.
