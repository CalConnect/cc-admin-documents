== Introduction

CalConnect Conference XXXIII took place on May 20-22, 2015, hosted by 1&1 in Buchares, Romania.
The CalConnect Conference was
attended by 21 people from 9 members, and two non-member observers. The Interoperability Test
Event was held immediately prior to the
Conference on May 18-20, 2015, and had 12 participants onsite from 6 members, respectable
attendance numbers for our first event in
eastern Europe.

At this Conference we again used our redesigned CalConnect Conference format, originally tried at
the January 2015 Conference, to provide
sessions of broader interest. Instead of our usual Technical Committee sessions, workshops and
BOFs, several sessions on broader topics
and at a higher level were offered, with the intent of providing more value to our participants.
Some of the very detailed discussions formerly
part of a conference TC session were moved to earlier in the week, during the Interoperability
Test Event. The Conference finished with the
CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The Conference agenda, with notes on the
discussion topics, may be found at CalConnect
XXXIII Schedule.

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become internet draft
submissions to the IETF and
ultimately be progressed to become RFCs
(Proposed Standards), rather than be directly published by CalConnect itself.

== Update on Technical Committee Work and Initiatives

=== CALSCALE Ad Hoc

The Ad Hoc was closed upon the publication of RFC 7529,
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-rscale/[Non-Gregorian Recurrence Rules in iCalendar (RSCALE)]

=== TC API

TC API spun off its data model discussion to TC DEVGUIDE. Much of the discussion has been on
simplified JSON data formats and
benefits/issues with REST APIs, and the need for a media type that defines a JSON document that
describes collection contents. Going
forward the TC will focus on mapping WebDAV multistatus to a JSON data format with its own media type.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

The TC has produced an initial draft of a mechanism for multiple service discovery via a single
protocol for client setup and submitted to the
IETF: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-daboo-aggregated-service-discovery/[Aggregated Service Discovery].
The protocol has been implemented in at least one server and one client. The TC is now dormant
waiting for an opportunity to move this forward at the IETF.

=== TC CALDAV

Work over last 4 months:

Shelved calendar resource drafts until/unless we see more client interest. We will refactor
Managed Attachments to use Server Info
Document once it stabilizes. Focused primarily on Server Info Document which now has an initial
draft: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-douglass-server-info/[draft-douglass-server-info].

* Decisions:
** Initial spec will probably punt on including per-service DAV properties/values
** Define a Server-Info-Token response header that servers can use to notify clients of a change
to server capabilities (rather than relying on clients to poll)
** Need a way for clients to specifically request that the server return Server-Info-Token
response header - currently If-Not-Server-Info-Token request header
* Open Issues:
** Should we use Server-Info-Token as both a request and response header or use a
If-Not-Server-Info-Token request header as in current draft?
Should we include "features" that are currently only discoverable via DAV properties, e.g.
sync-collection, add-member, current-user-principal
** Should we include a Link header with server-info-href and newly defined reltype in OPTIONS
responses? Some investigation into
a small number of clients yields that clients typically do a PROPFIND on .well-known before ever
doing an OPTIONS, so a client
could fetch server-info-href property in initial PROPFIND and potentially bypass OPTIONS completely
** Should server-info-href be available on ALL resources or limited to just a sub-set of resources
(e.g. .well-known, calendar-homeset, user principals)

Work for next 4 months:

Finish up the serverinfo document. Work on a public version of the CalDAV server matrix. Plan on a
client version of the matrix.

=== TC DEVGUIDE

The TC was established as a spin-off from TC API. Over the last four months it has had initial
discussions on topics that need to be covered
in the Developer's Guide. Over the next four months we will pick three high level topics and
create a detailed description of each. Additionally
alternative publication means such as github will be evaluated.

=== TC EVENTPUB

The TC became active to work on using QRCODE and data-uris to distribute events without the need
for network connections. An initial draft
was created for discussion. Over the next four months the TC will continue with the QRCODE work
and clarify the use case for embedded
data. Additionally a decision must be made as to whether a new URI scheme is the best way forward.

=== TC FREEBUSY

The TC has been working on the VPOLL specification:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-york-vpoll-00[VPOLL: Consensus Scheduling Component for iCalendar]. The basic specification is
mostly complete and the TC started work on other poll-modes such as task assignment and signup
mode. Task assignment would be
associated with project management. Signup would, for example, allow a simple signup to (probably
social) events, perhaps indicating what the signee would bring to the event.

Over the next four months the TC will continue work on defining the sign-up poll mode and work on
restructuring the draft.

=== TC FSC

TC FSC (Federated Shared Calendars) has been working on the invitation flow for shared calendars
and published calendars (e.g. enhanced
webcal) and will continue its work in this area, and has run into some issues on how to deliver
the invites over a secure connection without reinventing iSchedule.

Over the next four months the TC will mock up the invitation flow and upgrade process, make more
progress on authentication flows, and
plan for interop testing. It is jointly working with TC SHARING to resolve ambiguities in how
invitations are managed and sharing is handled in different circumstances.

=== TC IOPTEST

The TC planned for and conducted the interop testing event at CalConnect XXXIII, reported on at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/event-reports#ioptestevents[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event Reports]
Reports once completed. The TC will now begin planning for the testing at CalConnect XXXIV this autumn.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

TC ISCHEDULE discussed the relationship to TC FSC and whether the DKIM model used in iSchedule
migth be applicable to TC FSC, or
whether a different security model could be used for both FSC and iSchedule. Over the nexgt four
months, the TC will wait for the IETF
TZDIST working group to conclude, then update the iSchedule draft to use the scheduleto: URI
scheme and start encouraging the IETF to
initiate a working group to take the iSchedule draft forward.

=== TC PUSH

The TC has finished an initial specification of the Push Discovery and Push NOtificaiton Dispatch
Protocol, thought the draft still requires
updating. Members have implemented the application server portion, Push Gateways, and a client
that supports Push on Android. Over the
next four months the TC will continue to work on the spec.

=== TC RESOURCE

TC RESOURCE is dormant, waiting on its drafts to begin progression at the IETF.

=== TC SHARING

The base specifications for webdav resource sharing and webdav notifications have been published to the IETF:
https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing[WebDAV Resource Sharing]
and WebDAV Notifications. CalDAV sharing is almost complete. Over the next four months the TC will
continue to wor on the CalDAV sharing spec and continue discussions of contacts sharing.

=== TC TASKS

Over the last four months the TC looked into what is necessary to get client support for the new
properties, etc. A thorough review was
completed of all thenew items that might need to be included in interop testing. The TC also
reviewed time tracking aplications, and decided
the first step would be a new duration property to allow a record of time spent on a task. Also
looked at various ways task assignment is
being done, and how overdue tasks might be presented to users.

Over the next four months the TC will work on an event type taxonomy and continue working on tests
for the new drafts.

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-douglass-ical-relations/[Improved Support for iCalendar Relations]

=== TC TIMEZONE

The TC is on hold pending the progression of its two drafts at the IETF via the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-tzdist/[TZDIST Working Group]:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tzdist-caldav-timezone-ref/[Time Zone Data Distribution Service]
and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tzdist-caldav-timezone-ref/[CalDAV: Timezones by Reference].
The Time Zone Data Distribution Service draft is now in last call, and the Time Zones by Reference
draft has completed working group last call.
