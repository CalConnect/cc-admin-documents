== Introduction

The June 2009 CalConnect interoperability testing event was held at the Vendor 2 campus at Redwood
Shores, California. Participants of the testing event used predetermined test scenarios. Rather than post
the full scenarios in this document, they can be found on the CalConnect website at the following URL:
http://www.calconnect.org/ioptesting.shtml.

The documents used in this testing event were the CalConnect CalDAV Matrix for Draft 08, in particular
the scheduling section and iCalendar, iMIP and iTIP testing matrix. Summaries and specific findings and
issues found are noted in this document.

== Participant Comments and Findings

=== CALDAV Testing

==== Vendor 1

Vendor 2 server worked well with Vendor 1. We had some trouble at first with recurring meetings, but that
was resolved server-side. The only part of the interop that didn't end in an outright "Pass" was the use of
the inbox, since the server uses a "virtual" inbox and doesn't actually create and store messages in it.
Either way, this didn't really have any impact on Vendor 1. The auto-scheduling was working nicely.

Vendor 1 vs. Vendor 5:

We had some initial issues where the server did not adhere to various elements of the WebDAV/CalDAV
spec, which caused problems with loading the account into Vendor 1. I hacked around that on the client
side in order to test and reported the issues to Vendor 5, but that will need to be fixed server-side before it
will work with stock Vendor 1.

Vendor 1 encountered many 500 errors from the server, so testing was limited by that. The server was
continually setting the organizer's attendee to RSVP=TRUE, which caused display issues in Vendor 1.
The server also stripped all but display alarms. Free-busy lookups did work well, though.

Vendor 1 vs. VENDOR 3:

500 errors when adding alarms or attendees prevented much of the tests in the matrix.

==== Vendor 1 server observations

Primarily interested in testing with Vendor 6. Some bugs found and fixed. Overall seemed to work well.
We also did some CardDAV testing with Vendor 6. Again bugs found and fixed.

==== VENDOR 3 Observations

VENDOR 3 spent a significant amount of time with Vendor 6 testing the CardDAV server against their
Outlook plugin. As a first try went fairly well. Vendor 6 was eventually able to create and read CardDAV
entries.

Following day spent some time with Vendor 2 product testing iSchedule. After some fixing of bugs at both
ends managed to successfully handle a meeting invitation.

Vendor 1 tried against VENDOR 3 on Monday and ran into a recently introduced bug which was fixed soon
after. I don't believe they retried any tests.

==== Vendor 5 observations

Vendor 5 servlet vs. Vendor 1

Issues found that resulted in problems loading the account into Vendor 1 client. These issues do not
occur with the current release version of Vendor 1 Vendor 1 3.x. Additional testing with the Vendor 1
Vendor 1 4.0 client to understand the changes and tighter adaptation of the CalDAV specification in
specific areas is required on the Vendor 5 Servlet.

Found that a new draft regarding delegates is in the works and has been adopted by Vendor 1 and others
already. Vendor 5 will review and make changes as it appears to be a cleaner way to manage and display
delegates.

Found defects related to recurring patterns and modification of single instance. Additional instances
added after exceptions are made to the recurring string.

Need additional support in Vendor 5 CalDAV servlet for all notification options.

Need to determine why we are adding `RSVP=TRUE` value for the organizer of an event after a
modification. Caused internal error 500 issues and display issues.

Limited clients to test against server this time around.

==== Vendor 6 Observations

In summary the test event was very useful for us. From a CalDAV perspective all products are still in very
early stages (IMHO). The event showed quite a few serious issues in the CalDAV layer of all products.
For me this was a reason why we couldn't do that much 'formal' testing. We always ran into issues to be
solved quite quickly. What I basically did was:

. test against Vendor 2
** initially the server 'crashed' (500 HTTP error) on some requests sent by us, but Simon was able to
rather quickly fix this
** we tested a bit of implicit scheduling, this worked quite well
. test against the VENDOR 3 `LDAP<->CardDAV` gateway
** the VENDOR 3 CardDAV gateway was in its very early stages, so I worked with Mike to improve it
** at the end of the IOP we could get/edit contacts in the server.
** also discussed issues with cross-server CalDAV result sets, which VENDOR 3 seems to be using
and which seems to break many clients (didn't manage to test it). Cyrus suggested to use
WebDAV Binds instead.
. test against Vendor 5
** this server was a bit slow (requiring ~20s to update a record), but was the only one which didn't
produce 500 errors :-)
** didn't test that much on it, but the shallow testing I did, was OK
. test against Vendor 1
** we found issues in the 'principal discovery', when trying to query the root of the server
** this seems to be a rather 'generic' issue which produces interop issues
** We tested implicit scheduling and found a bug in our Vendor 1 code which we fixed on site.
** Discussed the implementation of WebDAV `XMPP`.
** (BTW: Vendor 1 didn't bring its new CardDAV server, but we successfully tested that before)

The table below shows the CALDAV testing matrix items tested by Vendor 6 against the Vendor 1 server.

== Summary

This Interop showed continued improvement in iCalendar and CALDAV interoperability. As is typical, 500
errors caused difficulties in interoperability with several clients and servers.

We are starting to see a bit of testing with CardDAV and iSchedule. This is still quite early in the
development cycle of these protocols and no set testing matrix is in place for testing.

Our thanks to all participants and contributors to this document.

Respectfully submitted by Pat Egen, CalConnect Interop Manager.
