== Introduction

CalConnect members have produced a
Technical Demonstration of key
calendaring and scheduling
technologies being developed by
CalConnect.

This serves as a technology "preview"
only and does not in any way represent
final protocols or products.

Our goal is to solicit feedback from
members and invited guests on the
presentation itself as well as the
technologies being demonstrated.

We also hope to show how CalConnect
is successfully achieving its goal of
improving calendaring and scheduling
standards.

== Agenda

* Introduction to CalConnect
* Technical Previews
** CalDAV Scheduling
** iSchedule
** Internet Freebusy
* Conclusion
* Q&A

== Introduction to CalConnect

=== What is CalConnect

An information technology
consortium focused on calendaring
and scheduling that is a partnership
between vendors and customers.

[quote]
Our vision of the future is not only
interoperable calendaring, but ubiquitous
interoperable calendaring. Calendaring
should--and can--be as ubiquitous as
electronic mail.

=== Why do we need it?

Our goals:

* improve general understanding
* promote the technologies
* improve the technologies, in
particular interoperability

[quote]
The driving premise behind the Consortium
is that interoperability between calendaring
programs and systems is essential to
achieving the promise and future growth of
calendaring.

=== Current Membership

=== Done so far?

* Substantial input to the IETF on new
versions of calendaring RFCs (e.g.,
recurrences, timezones, and
minimum interoperability subsets)
* Work on CalDAV, CalDAV Scheduling,
and extensions to CalDAV
* Recommendations and guidance on
Extended Daylight Savings Time
* Timezone Registry and Service
Recommendations
* Mobile Calendaring white paper and
Interoperability Test Suite
* Mobile Calendaring Recurrence
support
* Surveys and use cases for calendaring
events, tasks (``VTODO``s)
* Calendaring Glossary
* Calendar Administrator's mailing list
* Thirteen successful IOP test events
between C&S implementations
* First Mobile Calendaring IOP test
event
* Demo of Federated Freebusy data
consolidation in 2006

=== Ongoing work?

* TC-CALDAV
* TC-EVENTPUB
* TC-FREEBUSY
* TC-IOPTEST
* TC-ISCHEDULE
* TC-MOBILE
* TC-TIMEZONE
* TC-USECASE
* TC-XML

=== Where is it going?

* Continue with core goals
* Calendaring libraries/APIs to assist
implementations
* Calendaring as a platform (e.g. project
management)
* Types of calendaring infrastructures
(e.g. enterprise, federation, services,
ad hoc)
* Expand participation in new areas
** Vertical industry focus (e.g., mobile
operators)
** Government and private industry
customer perspective
** Overseas (Europe in short term,
Asia after)

== Technical Previews

* Today we will demonstrate:
** CalDAV Scheduling
** iSchedule
** Internet freebusy lookups using
freebusy URLs
* Each presentation will consist of:
** Introductory slides
** Live demonstration

== CalDAV Scheduling -- How it works

=== Introduction to CalDAV

* RFC4791 defines the CalDAV Access
protocol.
* Built on core internet technologies

[%unnumbered]

.Multiple Users can Access and Share Calendars

=== CalDAV Scheduling

How it works:

* Several users on one CalDAV server
(any client) schedule with each
other
* One user is the "Organizer", others
are "Attendees"

.One is the Organizer, others are Attendees
image::img05.png[]

There are two parts to scheduling:

* Freebusy lookup
* Sending invitations and receiving
replies

Freebusy results are returned
immediately.

Invitation replies are sent only after
users inspect and accept or decline.

Each user has an "Outbox" and an
"Inbox".
The "Outbox" is used to trigger
freebusy lookup.
The "Inbox" is where invites or replies
are delivered.
Changes to events trigger scheduling.
Clients monitor the "Inbox" for
incoming scheduling messages.

==== Demonstration #2 -- Simple meeting between multiple people with different clients some CalDAV others using a CalDAV "connector"

== iSchedule -- How it works

=== Basic Concept

* Provides the ability for users on
different calendaring systems to
schedule meetings with each other
* Instantaneous freebusy lookups
* Invites, replies sent as "messages"
with delivery status immediately
returned

=== Can't this be done today?

* But I can do scheduling with my
colleagues today!
* True, but only people on the same
server as you, or via some other
communication process such as email
or telephone.

=== Design of iSchedule

* Built on core internet technologies
* Can be used with any type of
calendar store (does not depend on
CalDAV)

== Freebusy URL

=== What is Freebusy?

* A list of free and busy periods for a
particular calendar user or resource
* Primarily used for scheduling
resources or meetings with other
people
* Time periods may be marked as
** busy
** free
** busy unavailable ("out of office")
** busy-tentative

=== Expressing Freebusy time

* Most commonly as a RFC 2445
VFREEBUSY object
** a request for freebusy time,
** a response to a request, or
** a published set of busy time

=== Sharing Freebusy

* CalDAV Scheduling
* iTIP/iMIP (email)
* iCalendar .ics file
* Freebusy URL (FBURL)

=== Why FBURL?

* Freebusy is LCD scheduling
* FBURL is LCD Freebusy (or could be)
* Easy
* Outlook supports a form of FBURL
* The market says FBURL is desirable
and useful
** tungle.com, timebridge.com,
timetomeet.info, doodle.ch
* Potentially bridge the divide between
enterprise calendaring and
** calendar/scheduling augmenters
** standalone calendaring clients (no
server)

=== What we have done

* Standardize/Normalize
* Parameters -URI template
* Error reporting within the HTTP
protocol
* Allow for non-authenticated or weakly
authenticated service
* Keep it simple (in its simplest form)
*Outlook compatibility
* Extend?
** Discovery
** Authentication
** Provisioning
** VAVAILABILITY
*** provide a grouping of available
time information over a specific
range of time.

=== How it works

* The "Read URL" is used to get
freebusy data for a user
+
--
http://www.example.com/freebusy/user1@example.com?start=20070901T000000-0800

http://www.example.com/freebusy/user1@example.com
--
* returns VFREEBUSY object
* The "Publish URL" is used by a client to
upload freebusy data for a user
+
--
http://www.example.com/freebusy/user1@example.com

http://www.example.com/freebusy?user=user1@example.com&token=xcsfdgetdh
--

=== What we will show you

* Basic form FBURL
** lookups - no publishing
** Accessing multiple servers from the
same clients
** Comparison with server-server
lookups

=== Freebusy URL Demonstration

==== Several clients retrieving freebusy information

== Conclusion

=== Wrap-up

* We have demonstrated how progress
is being made with key scheduling
technologies
* As with a lot of CalConnect work this
is a very interactive process with
specifications and implementations
being worked on together
* This ultimately provides for a better
specification and interoperability

=== CalDAV Scheduling

* A new CalDAV scheduling draft with
implicit scheduling support was
recently published and now we are
heavily testing that
* Hope to complete this by end-2008

=== iSchedule

* Demonstrated basic scheduling message
processing
* Key elements of iSchedule still need to be
developed:
** Discovery (use SRV records in DNS)
** Security - need input from security
experts as to what model(s) to use
* Hope to complete this by mid 2009

=== Freebusy URL

* Freebusy is LCD scheduling
* Freebusy is soft-core calendaring
* It is what we settle for, not what we
want
* But...Free/Busy is very, very useful
* CalConnect will continue to develop
FBURL
