.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of

== Introduction

CalConnect XXXIX took place on June 12-16, 2017, hosted by Tandem in Seattle, Washington. The
CalConnect Test Event (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning) and Conference (Wednesday
afternoon, Thursday and Friday) were held at Tandem's headquarters at Galvanize in Seattle.

The CalConnect Conference was attended by 16 people from 9 members plus a representative from the
IETF. The Test Event/Developers Forum had 8 participants from 5 members and was largely devoted to
the forum rather than specific testing.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and
finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The Conference agenda with notes
on the discussion topics may be found at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xxxix-june-12-16-2017%23conference-schedule[CalConnect XXXIX Conference Schedule].

== Status of documents since last conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become internet draft
submissions to the IEETF and ultimately be progressed to publication as RFCs (Proposed Standards),
rather than directly published by CalConnect itself.

Specifications in progress and not yet published are generally resident on GitHub either in our
public or private areas.
