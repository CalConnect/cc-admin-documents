== Introduction

CalConnect XLV took place June 3-6, 2019, hosted by You Can Book Me in Bedford, United Kingdom.
The conference was held on Google's premises, and was attended by a total of 13 people from 7
member organizations, plus attendees to a joint virtual working group session with the IETF CALEXT
working group. Friday morning, June 7, was also available as a working session for attendees.

The Conference focused on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and
finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Thursday. The schedule was rearranged during the
week based on input from participants. The final pre-event Conference agenda with notes on the

== General status and items from Conference XLV

The Ad Hoc Committee on Rich Text (in Calendar events) formed at CalConnect XLIV completed its
work and disbanded prior to CalConnect XLV.

A provisional Charter for a new TC USECASE was developed and will be completed this summer.

The Charter for TC LOCALIZATION is nearly complete and should be reviewed and adopted in the near
future.

CalConnect has approved as revised the IPR and Copyright policies and will formally adopt them
following this event.

Feedback on the new conference format is very positive and we will continue with this model.

TC PUSH has been reactivated to support movement of the specifications; the draft(s) will be
updated and resubmitted.

TC-AUTODISCOVERY has been reactivated. A new draft will be published following the work on TC-PUSH.

== Detailed Session Notes

CalConnect Member Representatives should refer to the CalConnect XLV Conference Notes in the
Conferences/CalConnect XLV folder on the CalConnect Document Repository for detailed session notes
and information.

== Plenary meeting

CalConnect will hold two rather than three events in 2020: a spring event in April and an autumn
event in late September/early October. Several participants noted that this would definitely help
planning for an attending CalConnect events going forward.

Strong interest in using Zoom in place of regular conference calls for committee calls; will try
with TCC and TC-DEVGUIDE calls following the event.

Joint Working Group meeting with IETF CALEXT was successful. Plan to do another in conjunction
with CalConnect XLVI in October. Also plan on doing Working Group meeting with ISO/TC 154 working
group.

Recommend referring to ourselves as "CalConnect" and not always add "The Calendaring and
Scheduling Consortium" as the latter doesn't reflect our full scope and future interests.

== Confirmed Future Events

* FastMail will host CalConnect XLVI on October 7-11, 2019 in Philadelphia, USA.

* Cronofy will host CalConnect XLVII on April 20-24, 2020 in Nottingham, United
Kingdom.

* CalConnect XLVIII will be in Autumn 2020, host, location and exact dates TBD.
