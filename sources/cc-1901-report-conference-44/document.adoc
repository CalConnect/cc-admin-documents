== Introduction

CalConnect XLIV took place February 5-8, 2019, hosted by Google in
Zürich, Switzerland. A Time Zone Workshop was held Tuesday
afternoon during the conference. The conference was held on
Google's premises, and was attended by a total of 31 people from 11
member organizations, and 5 external invitations to the workshop.

This conference was organized along the guidelines from the
previous conference in Karlsruhe; however, separate technical and
general tracks were eliminated. Instead sessions were identified by
session type. A single fee for the entire four-day conference was
charged. Additionally, we schedule a "codefest" for Monday, 4
February, with open attendance.

The Conference focused on strategic and possible work items in
addition to ongoing work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary
Session prior to lunch on Friday. Friday afternoon was scheduled
for working sessions. The schedule was rearranged during the week
based on input from participants. The final pre-event Conference
agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xliv-february-4-8-2019#conference-schedule[CalConnect XLIIV Conference Schedule].

== General Status and Items from Conference XLIV

The Time Zone Workshop planned by TC DATETIME was held on Tuesday afternoon.
Subsequent steps will be determined for TC DATETIME.

* Summary of event to timezonediscuss public mailing list.
* Press release writeup for news feed.
* Modify a system to fetch time zone data from a TZDIST server
* Investigate whether IANA could/would operate a TZDIST server
* Learn more about ISO TC 154 work to establish registry for time zone data

An Ad Hoc Committee on Rich Text (in Calendar events) was formed
and will conduct several calls over February and early March; the
committee is due to finish by mid-March.

An Ad Hoc Committee on Use Cases was formed to consider UI issues
for displaying multiple time zones and develop best practice advice
for UI developers.

The committee will develop a Charter for a new TC USECASE to be
considered at the next CalConnect event.

TC CALSPAM finished its work and will be closed following any
updates from the next M3AAWG conference in late February. Open
issues will be transferred to TC CALENDAR.

CalConnect has approved the new Standards Directives. Work
continues with related items such as revised IPR and Copyright
policies, and a co-publishing agreement with ISO and other
organizations.

Feedback was obtained on the new conference format as used at this
meeting. The consensus was that identifying sessions by category
was not as important as early descriptions of the planned sessions.

Plan for a 1-day hackathon on the Monday of the event week, with
the conference itself Tuesday-Friday. Establish a small charge to
give those who signed up some stake in actually coming.

Start to build in more testing time as JSCalendar gets more
traction. Way to involve non-members (perhaps via hackathon?)

Advertise events (and hackathon) more to non-members.

== Plenary Meeting

Ad Hoc Committees on Rich Text and Use Cases approved and will
start work immediately. Need charter for proposed TC USECASE asap.

TC PUSH to be reactivated.

TC CALSPAM will be closed.

TC LOCALIZATION has not moved forward at this point.

== Confirmed Future Events

* You Can Book Me (YCBM) will host CalConnect XLV on June 3-7, 2019 in Bedford, England.

* FastMail will host CalConnect XLVI on October 7-11, 2019 in Philadelphia, USA.
