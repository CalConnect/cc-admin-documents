== What is Testing outside of CalConnect

* Several organizations do testing for conformance purposes
* This is usually against a small subset of operations and uses testing tools
* The goal is to "pass certification"
* Some groups do very large TEST-FESTs again with the goal of conformance testing
** Typically limited to very specific test cases

== What is Interoperability Testing at CalConnect?

At CalConnect, we test partner pairs, at face to face functions:

* Specific test cases are outlined and documented
* Testing typically done by developers
** In some cases, the developers are the authors of the specifications being tested
* They are able to find and often times fix existing problems onsite
* Discussions with other developers are held
* Even though they are testing a specification, the developers know their products
* The ultimate goal is better interoperability across vendor implementations

== Testing Timeline

== Standards Development

As a protocol advances, our testing expands to accommodate the new specifications added to a protocol

* For example, Scheduling was added to CalDAV in the latter part of 2007.
* In 2008, we started testing vendor implementations of the specification
* This allows the vendors to see in real time how their applications perform against other products
** Seeing quickly what works or doesn't work allows the authors of the specification to make changes that will encourage interoperability
** Case in point --at the October 2008 Interoperability Testing Event, 8 servers and 4 clients held CalDAV testing and two of the clients supported CalDAV Scheduling

== Interoperability Testing Pre-Specification

* iSchedule is new in 2008
** Still in the discussion mode
** Not yet defined as a specification

* The CalConnect Community enabled members to work together and actually have interoperability happening prior to a specification creation
* In October, we tested implementations of the new "specification under development"
** This is an example of vendors quickly rolling out software using a proposed new specification
** In this case, it will lead to a specification that has a good chance of acceptance and interoperability

== How Do Organizations Participate

Any member or non-member may participate in a CalConnect Interoperability Test Event

* Submit a registration application
* Agreement to abide by the rules of the event
* Payment of the appropriate fee.

Any member or non-member may attend [underline]#a single# CalConnect Interoperability Test Event as an Observer

* The same bullet points as above apply

CalConnect provides the location, Internet connectivity, testing documents, and food

* Typically, a CalConnect member organization hosts the event

== What Happens at an Interoperability Event

* Participants provide details on how to access their servers and clients
* Test suites and/or Test Matrices are used for testing
* Partner testing pairs are set up and each pair tests using the testing documents
* Participants document findings and deliver them to the Interoperability Testing Manager
* Impromptu meetings are held during the event to allow participants to have adhoc discussions
** This is often the first time people who have been testing together informally meet for the first time
** Face to face testing has proven to be invaluable to participants

== Our October 2008 Event --Yahoo Campus

* 8 CalDAV Servers
* 4 CalDAV Clients
* IBM / Microsoft iCalendar testing

== What is Produced from the Testing

CalConnect produces two documents several weeks after the Testing is completed

* An [underline]#*members-only internal document*# details in depth who tested what, with whom and what failed or succeeded.
* A Public document outlines what was tested and general observations but excludes actual references to vendor results

The Public documents are shared with Standards organizations to assist them with modifications and/or enhancements to the tested specifications.

Prior CalConnect Reports available back to July 2004: http://www.calconnect.org/eventreports.shtml

== What is Publicly Available

* Test suites are publicly available on the CalConnect website
* Past Public reports can be downloaded and reviewed
* A new Virtual Testing Lab is in Beta now
** Once complete, external developers can use the Virtual Lab to further test their implementations

== Virtual Test Lab

The site is a series of work areas:

* User id request
* Logon screen
* Profile Setup
* Create a Test or
* Join a test event in progress
* Report findings on a Wiki page

== Future Projects

* Complete the Virtual Testing Lab (`VCITE`)
* We are currently working on an iCalendar validation tool that will reside on our website
** The goal is that people can paste iCalendar streams into the tool and it will identify issues and validate that the text is structured correctly
* Continued Interoperability testing on:
** CalDAV Scheduling
** CalDAV Security and Roles
** iSchedule
** Mobile Calendaring Testing
