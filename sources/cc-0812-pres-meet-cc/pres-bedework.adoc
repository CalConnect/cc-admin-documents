== Please Allow Me to Introduce Myself

Gary Schwartz

** Director, Communications & Middleware Technologies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
** Bedework Project Leader
** CalConnect Vice President & Chair of FreebusyTechnical Committee

== What I will be talking about

* Bedework, our open source, Java-based implementation of CalDAV

== Rensselaer History

The Rensselaer School was established in Troy, NY, in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer
"for the purpose of instructing persons ... in the application of science to the
common purposes of life."

It is

[quote,"Palmer C. Ricketts 2nd ed History of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1914)"]
____
...the first school of science and
school of civil engineering, which has had
a continuous existence, to be established
in any English-speaking country.

=== Open Source -- What do we mean?

* http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd[Open Source Initiative]
** The 'open source' label was invented February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California
** Wanted an alternative to "free software"
** 'Open source' coined by Chris Peterson
** Open source doesn't just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of
open-source software must comply with the 10 enumerated criteria

=== Open source is a continuum

* Product provenance
* Licensing terms
* Support
* Governance
* Sometimes east meets west -like when Georgia Tech integrated Zimbra (proprietary
version) into Sakai (open source) using CalDav, facilitating future integrations,
open source or otherwise.

=== OSS and the marketplace

* Open source is inherently neither better nor worse than other software development
or distribution models
* Open source provides another option, representing a different value proposition

== Bedework The Open Source Project

=== RPI and OSS

[quote]
____
[underline]#Whereas many university people enjoy a spiritual affinity for open source
software, our interest is more pragmatic.# As a campus-wide development group,
technologies and products with no license or usage fees are critical to providing
solutions which can be deployed with impunity. Our web foundation is largely built
atop products and technologies which have no usage fees, allowing us to deploy as
many instances, servers, CPU's, etc as necessary.

[quote]
____
[underline]#RPI relies heavily on and benefits from open source# software but seldom
contributes to open source. We believe this contribution will enhance Rensselaer's
reputation in the area of software development.
____

=== Interoperability

* Bedework's preoccupation with standards and interoperability is in large part
recognition that in many organizations, *Bedework is unlikely to be the only
calendaring product in an enterprise.*
* The ability to share and exchange data with other calendaring products and
environments is an important key to Bedework's future well-being as a product and a
project.

=== Standards compliance -- the double-edged sword

* Standards compliance is the key to Bedework's success -but
** potentially useful features that are not standards compliant impede interoperability.
** We could be more ingenious but sometimes no way to have our standards cake and eat it too.
** The heart wants what it wants.

== CalConnect And Open Source

=== OSS and CalConnect

* CalConnect vendor members
** Proprietary only
** Open source only -- Bedework, Mozilla, OSAF
** Dual mode -- Apple, Zimbra
** Mixed -- Google, IBM, Oracle, Sun, Symbian/Nokia, Microsoft

=== CalConnect and OSS organizations

* The world is flat - open source,
proprietary source, no source --
everyone is equal partner
* Sometimes open source organizations have more flexibility and agility and fewer
constraints to participate, to speak publicly

=== Ron Abel -- 4 postulates

. Open source reference implementations are
extremely critical in achieving adoption of open
standards for software interoperability.
. Standards organizations are the only way to get a
level playing field w.r.t new open source
applications for learning -- that won't happen
unless the open source projects/communities
participate.

=== OSS vendors -- why join CalConnect?

* Join CalConnect to add adopters? Unlikely. More likely to find collaboration
partners than customers
* CalConnect members generally get "it" when "it"= "open source".
* CalConnect vendor members generally get "it" where "it"= good products benefit from
interoperability, becoming stronger, more marketable products.

=== CalConnect as an open source entity

In Dreaming in Code", Scott Rosenberg referring to Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" said,

[quote,"Scott Rosenberg"]
____
Raymond identified 2 key prerequisites ...the *rise of a cooperative ethos* built
around a leadership style like Torvald's that *encouraged newcomers* and *welcomed
contributions*, and *strove to maximize the number of qualified participants*
____

== Why We Joined CalConnect

* We have history of collaborative (but not OSS) software development -- MTS
* We have a history of working with high quality people -- MTS
* We saw first-rate people doing exciting work and we wanted to be part of it.

=== Why we really joined

We were showing off as observers at a CalConnect Roundtable, and had to join to save face.

=== What RPI gets from participation in CalConnect, both as calendar developers and as a research university

Like the Beatles said:

[quote, Beatles]
____
And, in the end, the love you take/ Is equal to the love you make
____


* *Active participation* in CalConnect
** Chair FREEBUSY Technical Committee
** Chair Timezone Technical Committee
** iSchedule, CalDAV Technical Committees
** Publicity Committee
** Steering Committee
** Board of Directors

=== CalConnect -- the benefits

* CalConnect has many research university members. Getting together with like
institutions to discuss C&S and other topics of mutual interest.
* Interoperability Test Events are invaluable
* Influencing/informing standards is useful, and a responsibility

== The bottom line

We believe in interoperability and open standards -- CalConnect promotes both
