[heading=terms and definitions]
== Definitions

=== Calendar
A collection of events, tasks, journal entries, etc.
Examples include a person's or group's schedule,
resource availability, and event listings.

=== Scheduling
The exchange of request/invitations and
responses between organizers and attendees of
scheduled events, tasks or journal entries.

=== CalConnect
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium,
consisting of vendors and user groups interested
in promoting and improving calendaring and
scheduling [underline]#standards and interoperability#.

== Why CalConnect was established

=== 1996-1999

* 1996 Versit Consortium issued vCalendar
* 1996 IETF CALSCH working group started on iCalendar specification
* 1997 Work began on Calendaring Access Protocol (CAP) calendar server draft
* 1998 iCalendar (RFC 2445), iTIP (RFC 2446) and iMIP (RFC 2447) became proposed standards
* 1998-2000 Some interoperability testing

=== 2000-2004

* Work on CAP -- stopped
* Interoperability testing -- stopped
* Work on iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP -- stopped
* IETF CALSCH working group -- stopped
* Vendors started to diverge from the standards to enhance their products
* *The draft RFCs were not ready*
** Too ambiguous
** Too complex
** Untested

=== Establishment of CalConnect

CalConnect was founded in January of
2004 to promote interoperable
Calendaring and Scheduling.

[quote]
The driving premise behind the Consortium is that
interoperability between calendaring programs and
systems is essential to achieving the promise and
future growth of calendaring.

=== What is CalConnect?

* An information technology consortium focused on calendaring and scheduling
* A collegial partnership between vendors and customers working towards achieving common goals of interoperability and functionality

=== Why do we need CalConnect?

* Improve the general understanding and applicability of calendaring
* Promote the technologies
* Improve the technologies and standards, in particular with regard to interoperability

=== The Vision

[quote,"Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director"]
Our vision of the future is not only
interoperable calendaring, but ubiquitous
interoperable calendaring. Calendaring
should--and can--be as ubiquitous as
electronic mail.

[quote,"Pamela Taylor, CalConnect Board Member"]
Being able to schedule meetings with my
work group is important. But being able to
schedule an appointment with my
hairdresser could change the world.
