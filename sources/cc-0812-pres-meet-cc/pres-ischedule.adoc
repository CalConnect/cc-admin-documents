== Who am I?

* Mattias Amnefelt
* Infrastructure architect at Stockholm University
* Member of the iSchedule TC of CalConnect

== Introduction

* iSchedule--The Internet Scheduling Protocol
* Provides the ability for users on different calendaring systems to schedule meetings with each other

== CalDAV!= iSchedule

But I can do scheduling with my colleagues today!

True, but only people on the same server as you, or via some other communication process such as email or telephone.

CalDAV:: Client contacts a server to manipulate a calendar
iSchedule:: Server contacts another server to schedule on a user's behalf

== iSchedule

* Built on core internet technologies
** HTTP, SSL, iTIP
* Instantaneous `freebusy` lookups across systems
* Invites, replies sent as "messages" with delivery status immediately returned
* Can be used with any type of calendar store (does not depend on CalDAV)

== Current topics

Discovery:: How to find your server given your calendar address
Security:: How do I know who you are and what you are allowed to do?

== Standards status

Nothing published yet. Working on the first draft.
