== CalConnect II -- April, 2001

IETF CALSCH Working Group Interoperability Testing . Held Wed. April 11, 2001 - Fri. April
13, 2001 - 8:30 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.

This second interop test was held at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA . Stanford gratiously
donated the use of their facilities and network in order to help further the movement of our
standards. This interop focused on iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP. The testing matrix can be found
on www.calsch.org.

The first day Pat Egen, IETF CALSCH working group co-chair introduced everyone and
established the ground rules as well as let everyone know the network logistics within Stanford
and to her server at www.egenconsulting.com.

== General Summary

These notes are "homogenized" - in other words, names of vendors have been removed so you
can't tell who is who. Once the draft moves forward, we will post which vendor supports which
component. For purposes of this document, I will call them Vendor 1, Vendor 2 and Vendor 3. I
have also included a section with general notes as related by each vendor.

=== Vendor 1 notes/results

Overall there was good interoperability. In general the vendors were able to interoperate. They
were able to invite, reply, reschedule, and cancel to single instance meetings. There was some
problems with the timezones that were used in recurrence rules, as a result only minimal testing
was done with events with multiple occurrences. Finally, even though Microsoft was not there,
some interoperability was done with Outlook.

NOTE: "no" indicates that a vendor was unable to support a feature due to not implementing it,
bugs, or due to misinterpretation of the RFCs

==== Other Things That Worked

* Vendor1 was able to invite using recurrence rules
* Vendor2 was able to delegate
* Vendor2 was able to send VTODOs

What did not work:

* Vendor 2 was unable to support more than one instance on the same day
* No one supported sending floating time events
* Vendor 2 did not support event durations less than fifteen minutes
* Vendor 3 did not support slash format in rdates
* Vendor 2 was unable to send a response if RSVP was false (point for future discussion about
meaning of RSVP)
* Vendor 3 did not escape any of their special characters
* Some of Vendor 2's lines were longer than permitted in iCalendar

Some issues found were UID problems and then in timezone problems.

The only other interesting problem was distinguishing between removing a person and canceling.
From my point of view we did not end up doing a lot of testing. I am including a table of what
we support and what we tested. The table is not completed except for EVENTS

Other Issues encountered while doing ICAL testing at CalConnect2.

. Sent to a Bcc user via Location Doc: "Through xxxx Server/MIME format"; Person Doc:
"Prefers MIME". The Bcc user receives an invitation with all of the Typical Workflow
actions. Error: S/he should only have the "Add to Calendar" action.
. Reschedule notices are not displaying invitee response actions.
. Invitations from a French Vendor 3 client are received with no subject or date/time fields.
. Cancellation notices being received as Updates from vendor 1. Upon opening notice, you get
the correct pop-up indicating that the meeting has been cancelled and the entry is removed
from the Calendar. However, the "Update Calendar" button is not hidden, and if you click on
it it will recreate the entry.
. Cancellation of a repeating meeting from Vendor 3 doesn't remove entries from Calendar.
. Custom repeats from Vendor 3 (rdates) only display the first date in the "Repeat Options"
dialog in invitee's Calendar entry.

=== Vendor 3 Results

Comments from Vendor 3.

. Vendor 2 and Vendor 1 can retrieve EVENT REQUEST messages from Vendor 3
Server - But they would prefer that the Vendor 3 IMIP messages come in the
"multipart/mixed" MIME format. We have included this item in our bug list.
. We tried to import a REPLY from the other vendors. We were able to import Vendor 2's
REPLY . However, we could not import Vendor 1's REPLY messages. This was
because they were inserting the Recurrence-ID in the event REPLY message even
though it was a non-recurring VEVENT. Also, we had a bug in handling RSVP. We
were saving the change in the RSVP value of the attendee, which caused a UI bug. (In
our User Interface, the attendee was moved to an INFORM)
. Vendor 1 and 2 can receive our recurring EVENT REQUEST invitations.
. We can import Vendor 1 and 2's recurring REPLY messages. However, we get the same
number of e-mails as instances (i.e. 60 replies (messages) to 1 recurring event)
. We can import CANCEL messages from Vendor 1
. Vendor 2 could not import our mail messages from a Spanish or French user. -- Vendor 1
can display them OK using the Eudora mail program.
. We can import a recurring REQUEST from Vendor 2
. Vendor 4 created an event. They sent two REQUEST messages, sequence=0,
sequence=1, the first one sent RECURRENCE-ID, the second one did not. This is
Vendor 1's bug, and they may have fixed it.

What about others:

. No one implemented ADD.
. No one tested COUNTER or DECLINECOUNTER

The Vendor 3 team is working on fixing CalConnect-related bugs and will include the fixes in
future releases.

=== Chair Comments

This interop compared to the first one was a world of difference. Many many more things
worked and we were able to spend more time testing elements.

While Vendor 2 shows a lot "Untested", after reading notes, I believe many of these items were
indeed tested. We have developed a new testing form that will be used on the next interop test. I
know one vendor felt we had not done enough testing - I think he really wanted to prove it all
works. Well, most of it did! We still have a ways to go, but for the first time, everyone feels that
we have made progress and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The best part of the interop
was the interactions between the attendees. That will help ongoing efforts tremendously.
Everyone wants to do the next interop within the next 6-9 months. We don't want to wait too
long now that we have momentum.
