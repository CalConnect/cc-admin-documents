== What is CalConnect?

. A Partnership
** Between Calendaring & Scheduling Vendors and Customers

. Mission
** To provide a general understanding of, promote, and provide mechanisms so that 
Calendaring and Scheduling methodologies, tools and applications
can enter the mainstream of computing

. Not a standards development organization
** Promotes development and adoption of standards
** Influence SDOs and vendors

== Why a Consortium?

A focused environment to

* Re-energize Calendaring and Scheduling
* Provide a forum to discuss the direction for
standards and implementations
* Validate the existing standards
* Provide interoperability testing
* Drive requirements for changes to existing
standards, new and complementary standards
back into IETF, other bodies
* Promote standards and technologies to the vendor
and user communities

== How did it evolve?

== Goals of the Consortium

* Promote Calendaring & Scheduling
* Help drive the evolution of open standards
for Calendaring & Scheduling (iCalendar,
iMIP, iTIP, CalDAV)
* Conduct interoperability testing
* Collegial partnership between all members
to achieve Consortium mission and goals
* Develop a shared vision for the Calendaring
& Scheduling community

== Goals and Activities of the Consortium

. Promote Calendaring & Scheduling
** Press releases
** Media publications
** Trade shows
** Op ed pieces, articles and white papers
** Trade shows and speaking opportunities
** Regular Roundtables for members

. Interoperability testing and certification
** Periodic interoperability testing events
** Promotional events and publicity to announce
successful completion of testing
** Analyze results and report findings to IETF or
other relevant standards bodies on correctness
and completeness of standards
** Develop and implement independent test suites
for interoperability conformance tests
** Potential to eventually certify applications for
interoperability and conformance to Calendaring
& Scheduling standards

. Promote design and deployment of
standards and implementations
** Feedback on existing standards on correctness
and completeness
** Requirements assessment and development for
extensions to existing standards or new,
complementary standards
** Study and report needs of user community at
large for standards and products

. Promote collaboration among members
** Promote inter-member collaboration to improve
interoperability
** Promote inter-member collaboration on
instruction and training
** Support inter-member efforts to define new
areas for Calendaring and Scheduling

. Support common goals of members
** Member forum to establish and promote common
goals for Calendaring and Scheduling products
** Establish common messages of member
community as basis for promotional materials and
publicity on Calendaring and Scheduling
** Possible annual conference

. Develop a shared vision for the Calendaring
and Scheduling community
** Seek broad representation from vendors, academia,
customers and the open source community
** Sponsor roundtable discussions, online forums

== Events

. Interops (Interoperability Testing)
** Participation open to members and non-members (significant discount
for members)
** Two day event usually co-located with Roundtable
** Results published to relevant standards org
** Public version on Consortium website

. Roundtables
** "All hands" plenary meeting of membership
** Three per year midway between IETF meetings
*** help to drive each other
** Held in conjunction with Interops
** Technical committee working meetings
** Steering Committee meeting
** Review and status of technical committees
** Consensus on direction, next steps of Consortium

. Workshops
** First workshop tentatively planed for 1Q2006
** Public workshop or invitational depending on goal & topic
** Open to non-Consortium members
** Could be co-hosted with Roundtable or independent event

. Annual Conference
** Need is still under evaluation
** Would offer technology and product overviews, tutorials and classes,
demonstrations and vendor offerings
** Public conference with member discounts
