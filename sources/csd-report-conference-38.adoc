The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon.  The Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect XXXVIII Conference Schedule.
== Status of documents since last conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become
internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to publication as
RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than directly published by CalConnect itself.

Specifications in progress and not yet published are generally resident on GitHub either
in our public or private areas.

== Technical Committee Work and Initiatives Going Forward

Note:  Several dormant TCs were closed at the CalConnect XXXVIII Plenary and their work program (if any outstanding) and outstanding drafts if any merged into other TCs.

=== TC API

Working on a new key/value based data model.  Much of the work is done and the remainder will continue.  Work will be expanded to include VTODOs (i.e. Tasks Extensions to iCalendar) and perhaps contacts.  Next steps are implementations, develop specification and submit to IETF.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Draft update in progress

=== TC CALDAV

VPATCH and VINSTANCE are mature enough to begin implementation and testing.  Enhanced Sync draft starting to stabilize.  Closed and merged into TC CALENDAR.

TC CALENDAR established to further work across iCalendar, iMIP, iTIP, CalDAV, etc. and outstanding work merged to TC CALENDAR.  Will initially focus on iSchedule, VPATCH, VINSTANCE, Enhanced Synd.

=== TC DEVGUIDE
