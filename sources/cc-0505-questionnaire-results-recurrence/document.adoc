The Recurrence Technical Committee of CalConnect (The Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium) has collected specific
information on how C&S implementations have, or have not, implemented the Recurrence
Rules of RFCs 2445 and 2446, iCalendar
and iTIP. This document is part of the committee's work to compile actual usage
information and interoperability issues.

The Recurrence Committee recently collected information in the form of a Recurrence
Questionnaire, which allowed vendors and
other producers and consumers of iCalendar recurrences to list the features of
iCalendar that they implemented. The questionnaire
also contained space for comments about each line item in the RFCs and also overall
issues with recurrences. The Recurrence
Technical Committee has since analyzed the results of the questionnaire into this
document.

The Committee and the Consortium would like to thank all those who took part in this
effort by filling out the Recurrence
Questionnaire.

This document is generally available to all who responded to the questionnaire in
evaluating their implementation against others, and to
all organizations and implementors working with Calendaring and Scheduling
implementations. The Recurrence Technical
Committee of CalConnect would appreciate feedback on the value and relevance of this
material from those who make use of it.
Feedback and comments may be sent to the Executive Director of the Consortium via
Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org.

== Part 3

=== iTIP

==== Reschedules

Additionally we have issues with other vendors who send a new rule on
reschedule of recurring meeting. Reschedules are problematic for us with
interop with other vendors. THe other vendors want to remove the old set
and replace it with the new set, but we don't allow that. We preserve the
original set and try to move it to the new dates.times, but that isn't
always possible if the new set that's sent has fewer/more instances than
the original one.

Removing an invitee (not strictly specific to recurring):
For removing an invitee (which was bundled in with `CANCEL`), we do not
increment sequence number on the instance (recurring or single actually) so
that we can add that user back into the meeting later. If we increment the
sequence number on removal, then when we try to see who is coming to our
meeting, the sequence #'s will no longer match up - that data is stale now.
The responses will be off by 1 (from the removal). Remove should be a
separate workflow event, not requiring a bump of sequence number, be it
repeating or single.

==== Broken up recurrance sets

For meetings that have shifted, as in a 5 day daily repeating meeting:
Monday, Tuesday, Wedsnesday, Thursday, Friday all from 10-11am. If we
reschedule each of these individually to be of different times, say Monday
(9-10), Tuesday(8-9), Wedsnesday(7-8), Thursday(12-1), Friday(1-2) and then
reschedule the entire set to be from 3-4pm, does that mean that the user
wants each day to be from 3-4pm?

Additionally with the same scenario, if I change Monday's body item (or
just 1 other field, like Subject) and then apply that to the entire set,
should all of the data on Monday be deposited into the rest of the set?
What if I had booked a different Room for Thursday? What if all I expected
was the body to be updated (since that's all I changed) and now the
Subject, location, etc. - all the fields have changed (one vendor's
implementation). That's not what I expected - I expected to know that I
only wanted to update just the body field, but ical does not give us the
information to know that we only intended to change body for just this
instance.

Vendor has a bit of iTIP implementation, enough to accept/reject invitations, but that's it.

=== Rules and Rdates

`RDATE` is not supported at all (WHY?)

The iCalendar Recurrence rule section is very elaborate. I'm not aware of any product that
conforms to it fully. Specifically, most products recognize only one `RRULE` and the others are ignored.

There is more than one way to specify recurrences. For example, we can specify a daily event as a
`FREQ=WEEKLY` event with weekday = su, mo...sa or as a `FREQ=DAILY`. It is relatively easy to
implement a recurrence engine to generate events using the rules, but we find it hard to recognize
it as a daily event to be displayed in User Interface.

What is the acceptability of interpreting one rule as another (e.g. reinterpret yearly as every 12 months repeat)?

No support for multiple ``RRULE``s.

No support for ``EXRULE``s.

Cannot modify the `RRULE` attribute (But ``RDATE``s and ``EXDATE``s can be added).

No support/limited support for these attributes: `INFINITE`, `SECONDLY`.

Vendor supports a special recurrence option for monthly meetings where an instance
that falls on a weekend
can be shifted to a weekday, either the preceding Friday, the following Monday, or
whichever is closer.
There is no way to sufficiently represent this in iCalendar. Hypothetically, a
complex series of ``RRULE``s can
come close, but in cases where the adjustment would cross a month boundary there is
no recourse.

Vendor is using a lot the `RECURRENCE-ID` / `UID` identification in data model to
represent "detached" events,
specialization for a given occurrence in a recurrence. This is apparently a much
debated point in the
interpretation of the specification. Vendor would like to stress the fact that iTIP
support is great for invitation
interoperability, but the first level should be even before invitations handling,
just representation of a given
calendar ("`PUBLISH`" support) so entire calendars can be published, stored, subscribed
and imported.

Some other problematic points with recurrences, as seen by Vendor:

* the exact semantic of date-based triggers for alarms set on a recurring event
* the lack of a standard, commonly accepted vtimezone definitions is a major
roadblock to correctly interpret recurrences.

=== Date handling

`DTEND` property was not well defined. For example, if we have event with
`DTSTART=20040404T100000` and `DURATION=PT2H`, it is not clear if the
`DTEND` should be 120000 or 115900. We have seen iCalendars with both the conventions.

All times are written in UTC (even when the event/todo has an `RRULE`) - (WHY?)

=== Timezones

Though not directly linked to recurrences, the timezone is one of most difficult part to implement
and least useful for majority of users. Many users just use one timezone.

The big piece of hard functionality from 2445 that vendor hasn't implemented is timezones.

Standard C library APIs deal well with only two timezones: UTC, and the local
timezone (whatever that is).
So, vendor's library works well in these two cases, including with ``RRULE``s that cross
DST shifts. Vendor
needs to implement a date-time abstraction that uses timezones as specified by
`VTIMEZONE`. Vendor
Vendor hasn't had the time yet. Suspects that the widespread lack of good APIs to
deal with timezones
will be the biggest interop headache for many implementations. But, vendor feels that
we can't take
timezones out of the spec, they are critical to how time is measured/used, and we
need a protocol that
will work properly between CUAs in various timezones. This is hard, but necessary.

Vendor confused by 4.6.5.c and posted two possible answers:

. We never export invalid time zone information, and we never reference undeclared time zones.
. A recurring appointment which gets shifted by a time zone (e.g. Daily from 1pm to
2pm PST) *can* have an exception which is all day long (floating).

=== CPL

Vendor implements a subset of RFC 2445, primarily `RRULE` reoccurrence to do time
handling as specified in CPL
in CPL (RFC 3880) - which in turn refers to RFC 2445 for it's implementation. CPL is
a script language which
allows for the declaration of complex call forwarding behaviors, in IP telephony systems.

=== Sequence Number

Vendor has not seen any product that uses the sequence number field correctly.

=== vTo Dos and vJournal

Partial support for ``VTODO``s (Intending on improving it).

Support for ``VJOURNAL``s in our internal API but not in iCalendar.

Vendor does not support `VJOURNAL` (little customer interest)

=== General Comments

It's not clear if the questions are for reading or for writing
Vendor's product really doesn't implement an iCalendar protocol.

Vendor licenses its operating system as a platform for handset manufacturers to build their
products with. The answers to the questionnaire describe what conformance is enabled by the PIM
data stores provided in a particular version of the vendor's operating system
Other versions do not provide iCalendar parsing/generation or RFC 2446 implementation - this
functionality will be provided by handset manufacturers.

Vendor has created a toolkit, which at its lowest level is built on an RFC 2425
encoder/decoder,
so it's possible to encode `ANYTHING`. An app built on this toolkit may encode
according to the
`MUST` rules, or may not, so many of the questions don't really apply. You can do it
right, or you can do
it wrong, and on decoding, vendor tries and be liberal in what is accepted. So, most
of answers are either
`OTHER` or `NO`. Despite this, vendor feels compliance is pretty good (in the things
implemented), it's just
that it's very hard to write a flexible toolkit that makes it impossible to generate
calendars that break the rules.

Lots of stuff vendor hasn't done are easy, just haven't had the time or need for them yet.

In general, vendor does not always return errors for incorrect data input. However,
they consume correct
data properly, and produce right data in most of the above cases.

Vendor has always considered it unusual that monthly recurrence rules that might fall
outside the range of
shorter months result in the instance being skipped. Vendor actually forbids such a
meeting, but if iCalendar
is to allow such a recurrence rule, it should follow the lead of many other
applications and pull the instance
back to the last day of the month. Currently, it's just a little silly. If a
company's employees get paid on the
15th and 30th of every month, shouldn't my iCalendar-compliant accounting application
be capable of doing "the right thing" in February?

Vendor's resource scheduler product does not accept iCal documents, only generates
them. Currently does not create recurrence data.

Vendor's library provides applications with support for recurrences mainly in three areas:

* translating RFC2445-style recurrences into an internal structure;
* creating recurrences (and exceptions) with a procedural API;
* iterating over instances.

Everything else is expected to be handled by the application.

More tests are needed. This is a direct consequence of the extreme complexity of the
specification and the many corner cases that need to be tested. +
(What are the complex areas and what corner cases need to be flushed out?)

== Part 4

. Would you like to see a similar questionnaire for all of RFCs 2445 and 2446 (knowing that it would be quite large).

--
Vendor would like to see similar questionnaire for all of RFCs 2445 and especially 2446.

Vendor would like to see a similar questionnaire for RFC2445 and 2446.
--

. Was it worthwhile for you to fill this out in the sense that it allows you to compare your implementation to the proposed standards?
+
--
Yes

It was useful to fill out the questionnaire.
--

. Can you offer us any additional comments to help us do better in the future?
+
--
To be accurate, the question "Does your product conform the specification" should be
split into (a) Does your product access
iCalendar objects conforming to the specification and (b) Does your product generate
iCalendar objects conforming to the specification.
I've answered the second question because most of the time, we were reading iCalendar
objects generated by us.

_[ We will answer this part in the second questionnaire by asking those exact questions ]_

Another vendor commented about the use of yes/no instead of producing/consuming.

Vendor thought It would be very helpful when all the replies would be open for
reading by everyone, so that we can compare our implementations.

Vendor felt that to assist completion of future questionnaires, examples for complex
areas would be useful.
