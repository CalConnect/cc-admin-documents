== Introduction

CalConnect members have produced a
Technical Demonstration of key
calendaring and scheduling
technologies being developed by
CalConnect.

This serves as a technology "preview"
only and does not in any way represent
final protocols or products that may or
may not ship.

This is a follow-up to the demo at
Roundtable X (September 2007).

Our goal is to solicit feedback from
members and invited guests on the
presentation itself as well as the
technologies being demonstrated.

We also hope to show how CalConnect
is successfully achieving its goal of
improving calendaring and scheduling
standards.

== Agenda

Today we will demonstrate:

* CalDAV Scheduling
* Realtime Internet Scheduling
* Internet freebusy lookups using
freebusy URLs

Each presentation will consist of:

* Introductory slides
* Live demonstration

== Technologies

CalDAV Scheduling:

* The CalDAV access protocol
(RFC4791) is based on WebDAV and
iCalendar standards
* In the CalDAV scheduling
specification (still a draft), users on
the same server system only
schedule with each other
* There are several server and client
implementations available

Realtime Internet Scheduling:

* Allows scheduling between users on
different server systems (e.g.
between organizations)
* The protocol uses HTTP to transport
iCalendar scheduling messages
* We will be demonstrating the basic
exchange of scheduling messages
* The security and discovery pieces
are still to do (TC-REALTIME)

Freebusy URL:

* This is a way to do simple exchange
and publishing of freebusy
information
* TC-FREEBUSY is working on a
specification
* It uses simple HTTP GET/PUT
operations with discoverability

== CalDAV Scheduling

How it works:

* Several users on one CalDAV server
(can be using different clients)
schedule with each other
* One user is the "Organizer", others
are "Attendees"

One is the Organizer, others are Attendees. Each stores their calendars on the Server.

There are two parts to scheduling:

. Freebusy lookup
. Sending invitations and receiving
replies

Freebusy results are returned
immediately.

Invitation replies are sent only after
users inspect and accept or decline.

Each user has an "Outbox" and an
"Inbox".
The "Outbox" is used to trigger
freebusy lookup or send invites or
replies.
The "Inbox" is where invites or replies
are delivered.
Clients monitor the "Inbox" for
incoming scheduling messages.

== Realtime Internet Scheduling -- How it works

=== Basic Concept

* Provides the ability for users on
different calendaring systems to
schedule meetings with each other
* Instantaneous freebusy lookups
* Invites, replies sent as "messages"
with delivery status immediately
returned

=== Can't this be done today?

But I can do scheduling with my
colleagues today!

True, but only people on the same
server as you, or via some other
communication process such as email
or telephone.

== Freebusy URL

=== What is Freebusy?

A list of free and busy periods for a
particular calendar user or resource.
Primarily used for scheduling
resources or meetings with other
people.

Time periods may be marked as

* busy
* free
* busy unavailable ("out of office")
* busy-tentative

=== Expressing Freebusy time

* Most commonly as a RFC 2445
`VFREEBUSY` object
** a request for freebusy time,
** a response to a request, or
** a published set of busy time

=== Sharing Freebusy

* CalDAV Scheduling
* iTIP/iMIP (email)
* iCalendar .ics file
* Freebusy URL (`FBURL`)

=== Why FBURL?

* Freebusy is "least common
denominator" (LCD) scheduling
* `FBURL` is LCD Freebusy (or could be)
* Easy
* Outlook supports a form of `FBURL`
* The market says `FBURL` is desirable
and useful
** ifreebusy.com, tungle.com,
timebridge.com, timetomeet.info,
doodle.ch
* Potentially bridge the divide between
enterprise calendaring and
** calendar/scheduling augmenters
** standalone calendaring clients (no
server)

=== What we have done

* Standardize/Normalize
* Parameters -URI template
* Error reporting within the HTTP
protocol
* Allow for non-authenticated or weakly
authenticated service
* Keep it simple (in its simplest form)
* Outlook compatibility
* Extend?
** Discovery
** Authentication
** Provisioning
** `VAVAILABILITY`
*** provide a grouping of available
time information over a specific
range of time.

=== How it works

* The "Read URL" is used to get freebusy
data for a user
+
--
http://www.example.com/freebusy/user1@example.com?start=20070901T000000-0800

http://www.example.com/freebusy/user1@example.com
--
* returns `VFREEBUSY` object
* The "Publish URL" is used by a client to
upload freebusy data for a user
+
--
http://www.example.com/freebusy/user1@example.com

http://www.example.com/freebusy?user=user1@example.com&token=xcsfdgetdh
--

=== What we will show you

* Basic form `FBURL`
** lookups - no publishing
** Accessing multiple servers from the
same clients
** Comparison with server-server
lookups

=== Demonstration #1 -- Several clients retrieving freebusy information

=== Demonstration #2 -- Project management aided by freebusy information

=== Wrap-up

* We have demonstrated how progress
is being made with key scheduling
technologies
* As with a lot of CalConnect work this
is a very interactive process with
specifications and implementations
being worked on together
* This ultimately provides for a better
specification and interoperability

=== CalDAV Scheduling

* Work still needs to be done to fine tune
CalDAV scheduling
* Ongoing discussions in TC-CALDAV
center around moving most of the
scheduling message processing to the
server for better reliability
* Hope to complete this by mid-2008

=== Realtime Internet Scheduling

* Demonstrated basic scheduling message
processing
* Key elements of Realtime Internet
Scheduling still need to be developed:
** Discovery (working on DNS-SD
implementation right now)
** Security - need input from security
experts as to what model(s) to use
* Hope to complete this by end of 2008

=== Freebusy URL

* Freebusy is LCD scheduling
* Freebusy is soft-core calendaring
* It is what we settle for, not what we
want
* But...Free/Busy is very, very useful
* CalConnect will continue to develop
`FBURL`
