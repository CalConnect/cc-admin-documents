.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of

== Introduction

CalConnect XLI took place January 31 - February 2, 2018, hosted by Oath in
Sunnyvale, California. The CalConnect Test Event (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
morning) and Conference (Wednesday afternoon, Thursday and Friday) were held at
Oath's Sunnyvale campus.

The CalConnect Conference was attended by 19 people from 11 members, plus two
CalConnect Directors for a total of 21 The Test Event/Developers Forum had 7
participants from 6 members and was largely devoted to the forum and CalDAV Tester
rather than specific testing.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing
work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The
Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xli-winter-2018#conference-schedule[CalConnect XLI Conference Schedule].

== Status of Documents Since Last Conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become
internet draft submissions to the IEETF and ultimately be progressed to publication as
RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than directly published by CalConnect itself.

Specifications in progress and not yet published are generally resident on GitHub either
in our public or private areas.

=== CalConnect Drafts to be Published as Informational RFCs

* CalDAV Managed Attachments (TC CALENDAR)

=== CalConnect Drafts in CALEXT Working Group Last Call at IETF

* Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar (TC CALENDAR)
* Improved Support for iCalendar Relationships (TC CALENDAR

=== CalConnect Drafts in Progress at CALEXT Working Group at IETF

* JSCalendar: A JSON representation of Calendar data

=== New and Updated CalConnect Drafts at the IETF

* Calendar Subscription Upgrades
* The Time Zone Data Distribution Service (TZDIST) Geolocate Extension
* The Time Zone Information Format (TZif)

== General Status and Items

CalConnect has established a formal Category A Liaison with ISO/TC 154 and is
exploring a similar liaison with ISO/TC 46. We have also established a reciprocal
membership liaison with M3AAWG.

IETF is considering reopening the TZDIST working group to deal with the new Time
Zone drafts we have submitted.

CalConnect is discussing whether or not it would be a provider of services (such as a
registry) or not. Alternatively we might act as the steward of an effort if not the service
provider.

Some discussion on a new TC USECASE to try and help developers understand what
is not fit for the purpose.

Will initiate a new TC CALSPAM to work on calendar spam best practices, a joint effort
with M3AAWG.

== Future Work

=== Ad Hoc on Streaming

Work on goals, ideas, objectives

=== TC API

Work on JSCalendar is progressing, accommodating contacts and tasks as well as
events.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Pending; Draft update in progress

=== TC CALENDAR

New Time Zone drafts on a geolocate extension and information formats.

Informational RFC on 5545 listing all RFCs connected to calendaring and needed to
understand, including acknowledging CalConnect.

IMIP extensions to better support calendaring invites and responses.

CalConnect be steward of possible time zone distribution service, but not actual
service provider. Google may be interested in providing such a service.

=== TC DEVGUIDE

Fill in gaps in current information, look at use cases. Do we need a TC USECASE?

=== TC IOPTEST

Support Tokyo event.

See separate report on Test Event at CalConnect XLI. TC IOPTEST calls have been
integrated into the Event Planning calls and no separate TC IOPTEST calls were held.

=== TC PUSH

Draft has been submitted to the IETF; we are exploring which working group should
handle it. Looking for more implementations.

=== TC SHARING

Annotation, subscription, server side subscription

=== TC TESTER

Brief report on the status of the work.

Maintain liaison with ISO TC 211, progress work
