=== iCalendar testing

A iTIP test matrix and iCalendar test streams were validated against various products.

The following are generic notes that describe some of the results of the interop testing.

=== CALDAV testing

Several servers and clients were able to test much of the CALDAV matrix. On the server front, some
minor issues were found during testing, but for the most part the servers are holding up well. Again, due
to bugs found during testing, not much of the Free Busy or Scheduling was able to be tested.

On the client side, a number of issues with CALDAV interoperability with other servers were found with
problems occurring on all sides. Some server problems were fixed and re-tested as working.

==== Examples of items found were

* Calendar-query report not matching any event occurrences in some cases
* COPY to the same location should not be allowed
* HTTP Error 409 Conflict returned when overwrite HTTP header is false, should be 401 or 403
* `VFREEBUSY` component should always contain GMT times
* Publishing only a project calendar using CALDAV.
* Not deleting events from CALDAV server during next publishing.
* Needing to publish more information about tasks in event Descriptions
* Not properly handling all-day meeting invitation generated by another vendor's product.
* Using incorrect `Content-Class:urn:content-classes:calendar-message` instead of `Content-Class:urn:content-classes:task` when sending tasks.
* client expecting an ETag on collections
* One vendor adds an Organizer to the events they created.
* bugs were associated with setting of calendar properties.
* problems with user principals
* products sending many simultaneous requests.

==== Example of things tested

* Ability to connect and publish ``VEVENT``'s and ``VTODO``'s to a CALDAV server
* Adding a configuration pane to the Application to support changing server connections.
* Summaries and descriptions to each task.
* Subprojects as all day events.
* `TODO` support and MKCalendar support
* absorb and completely ignore a vvenue component.

Cyrus Daboo of Apple created a test tool which was run against several servers at the event. A brief
report on results was posted and made available to other vendors. This showed that there is still much
work to do to have servers with full compliance to all details of the CALDAV spec, but progress is being
made. A number of issues were reported back to vendors. Note -- the report created by the CALDAV tool
mentioned above can be found later in this document.

All vendors felt that the Interop Testing event was an effective way to test compatibility. Several vendors
mentioned the need for more test cases for exceptions, particularly with recurring events with multiple
exceptions.

=== iCalendar Testing

Examples of things found during iCalendar testing

* Task interoperability issues that stem from a simple IMIP component tag missing.
* Not handling `TENTATIVE` status and broken Cancel.
* All day appointment expectations where there is no time (unlike Microsoft).
* And of course, the odds and ends little bugs that are always found.
* A lot is working today with most of the attendees.

=== Summary

As usual there were several bugs found during testing. Quite a bit more of CALDAV was able to be
tested this event and several iCalendar iMIP and iTIP objects were passed among the vendors for testing.
The CALDAV testing matrix is the same one used in the September 2006 testing. At that time, not
everyone was supporting scheduling. We continue to test as much as we can on the new scheduling
sections.

As suggested by several participants, we will be looking at some virtual interop testing between onsite
events. The virtual interops are not meant to take the place of on-site testing. Too much value is deriving
from the one-on-one, in person interactions. However, continued testing between events will help find
discrepancies that can be resolved prior to the next onsite event.
