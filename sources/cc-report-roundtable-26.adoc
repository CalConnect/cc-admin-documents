.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of
ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the
editorial rules of the CalConnect Directives.

== Introduction

NOTE: Incorporates material formerly distributed via the CalConnect _Minutes_ newsletter, now discontinued.

Roundtable XXVI took place on January 30 - February 1, 2013, hosted by Oracle in Santa Clara, California. The Roundtable was
attended by 29 people from 16 members and 3 non-members. The CalConnect Interoperability Test Event was held immediately
prior to the Roundtable on January 28-30. Nineteen people from 9 members were present onsite, and 2 members participated
remotely. In total, 36 people attended, including 2 from Europe, 1 from India, and 1 from New Zealand.

The Roundtable was dedicated to technical committee sessions, and informal discussions and networking, with an all-hands
Plenary meeting as the last item on Friday afternoon. The Technical Committee sessions were as usual organized sequentially,
without competing parallel sessions, as is our standard practice to allow all attendees who wished to be involved in the
discussions of each Technical Committee the opportunity to do so.

== Special Events

Wednesday afternoon, January 30th, was dedicated to the Consensus Scheduling Workshop. The workshop was open to the public
with prior registration and drew three participants from non-members. The workshop was announced on the
https://calconnect.wordpress.com/2012/12/13/calconnect-consensus-scheduling-workshop-january-30-2013-at-calconnect-roundtable-xxvi/[CalConnect Blog Workshop Announcement]
and the post-workshop report will also be posted to the blog.

== Documents since Last Roundtable

Much of the work in CalConnect is necessarily focused on specifications to
become internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to
become RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than be directly published by CalConnect itself.

== Update on Technical Committee Work and Initiatives

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

We discussed the status of the current draft which has now
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-daboo-aggregated-service-discovery/[moved over for consideration in the IETF].
Recent changes include a
switch to using JSON instead of XML. The IETF should be holding a BOF at the next IETF meeting to develop interest there
with a view to setting up a working group to develop the specification further. The TC will in the future work on supporting the
IETF effort and promote interoperability testing at CalConnect.

=== TC CALDAV

* Described latest modification to the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-caldav-attachments-01[managed attachment] draft.
Really productive conversation around identifying a
managed attachment.
* Presented the proposed http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-sharing.txt[calendar sharing model]: some issues were raised around scalability of the solution for people
managing large number of calendars.
* CardDAV sharing: 2 possible approaches were discussed (group level or address book sharing).
* Calendar Searching: discussed the bootstrap process: what should be the target URI for calendar search reports.

=== TC EVENTPUB

We briefly covered the state of the new properties defined for event publishing, STRUCTURED-LOCATION, PARTICIPANT,
STRUCTURE-RESOURCE and STYLED-DESCRIPTION. These have been described and discussed at previous Roundtables so
this was largely a status report. The
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-02[internet draft has been refreshed]
and there are a number of comments to be circulated to the
group and discussed.

Most of the session was taken up discussing the need for new properties to enable enhancements in itineraries. Examples are the
need to specify starting and ending locations for events, chaining of events and tasks, and properties to hold information such as
flights. It was agreed that detailed information may be better kept elsewhere with well-defined references to that information.
Next steps for itineraries involve a discussion of needs and identifying which TC or TCs will handle the work. It is hoped that
writing a "7 Things You Should Know About Itineraries" or a white paper may help attract new members to the TC. The other
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-icalendar-extensions-06[extensions draft]
which covers images has also been refreshed, and in the next few weeks we will discuss how to make progress
with both drafts.

=== TC FREEBUSY

The TC hosted the Consensus Scheduling Workshop on Wednesday afternoon. The workshop covered the key aspects of
consensus scheduling and described CalConnect's proposed solution:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-york-vpoll-00[VPOLL].
The workshop started with a detailed overview of
what consensus scheduling is, why people use it, and why standards - currently lacking - would enhance the process. This was
followed by overviews of various products that do some form of consensus scheduling or booking. We then had a detailed
overview of the VPOLL specification, covering the key elements and recent changes made by the TC. This included a description
of how the POLL-MODE property will be used to define various modes and levels of complexity for polls. Initially there will be a
simple "basic" mode that will be used as the basis for initial interoperability testing and will be used to encourage implementors to
develop products. Going forward the TC will work on refinements to the VPOLL specification based on feedback from
implementors. We plan on VPOLL testing at the next Interoperability Test Event event.

=== TC IOPTEST

The interoperability testing sessions were fairly busy and featured both new and established testers. There was a significant
amount of work testing many of the basic CalDAV functions and beyond that to testing implicit scheduling. Some of us spent
most of our time working on iSchedule, testing the new DKIM canonicalization. This was a successful test with events and
freebusy being transferred. Most problems related to the non-standard disposition of the services. There was some work in getting
the CalDAV test and performance suites running. In addition there was some timezone service testing with the new JSON format
and a certain amount of iMIP.

A useful feature of the sessions was the occasional informal discussions which involved most of the participants. We covered
some of the detailed issues related to sharing and notifications.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

After an general introduction to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-desruisseaux-ischedule-04[iSchedule],
we reviewed presented the main changes in Draft 03.

Interoperability testing feedback:

* 4 Servers participated in the tests
* Successfully tested new canonicalization algorithm

IETF status:

* Trying to get a working group started, most likely via DOSETA. We reviewed the process required to do so.
* CalConnect members need to show interest in order to justify working group in the IETF
* Some IPR issues with DKIM; the IETF working group will have to deal with it before we can proceed.

=== TC RESOURCE

We had a short session where we reviewed the work of the TC to date, current discussions, and work remaining. The new
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vcard-objectclass/[vCard objectclass property]
and its value of a https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vcard-schedulable/[schedulable]
was introduced and we went over an example of how it would be used. The TC is working on 3
drafts to get the work standardized - those just mentioned plus
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cal-resource-vcard/[vCard Representation of Resources].

=== TC TIMEZONE

The current state of the https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-douglass-timezone-service-07[Timezone Service Protocol]
was presented. The only change is from an XML based approach to JSON.
This approach is more in line with the expected use by web developers. The main outstanding service issue is how to deal with
inactive timezones. While there appear to be about 80 timezones currently in use there are over 400 in the Olson database. We
discussed timezones by reference: that is, servers don't send timezone data and clients use their own cached copy. This is largely
in line with current practice though not in line with the specifications. We talked about a registry for timezone related information
and how we should proceed. Finally the issue of allowing a TZID for DATE values was mentioned - RFC5545 disallows it, but
users want it.

=== TC USECASE

Lively first discussion about the merits of calendar user community involvement in CalConnect and possible ways to enhance
CalConnect discovery (that is, finding out CalConnect exists and what it is), to provide useful value to the user community, plus
some concrete first steps CalConnect can take to support the commerce of ideas and needs between user and vendor communities.

=== TC XML

We reviewed the history of https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6321[xCal: the XML format for iCalendar],
how we developed the SOAP and RESTful CalWS protocols and
how we had influenced the development of WS-Calendar within OASIS for the SmartGrid. The current state of the jCal data
model was described and we finished up by agreeing to try to get server side libraries working for the next Roundtable.

=== VTODO AD HOC

The session covered the proposed charter and work items that the Ad Hoc has been working on since the last Roundtable. We
have carefully analyzed the requirements for improving task handling in iCalendar, prioritizing the work we think needs to be
done. We looked at other task-based systems, including WSHumanTask, to inform our work. In addition, we took care to rule out
certain issues to keep the scope of any TC constrained to a reasonable set of deliverables. The Ad Hoc anticipates that a number
of items will re-use work done in other TCs. At this point we proposed that a TC be setup in CalConnect to move forward with
this work, and expect a decision on setting up a TC to be made during the Roundtable Plenary. TC TASKS was approved, and we
will move ahead with the work items.

== Plenary Decisions

A new TC TASKS technical committee was created to carry out the work program identified by the VTODO Ad Hoc Committee,
which reported out at this event recommending the formation of such a new TC.

We have accepted an offer from http://www.dhl.com[DHL Express] to host the Autumn 2013 CalConnect event at their ITS Data Center in Prague,
Czech Republic, the week of September 23-27, 2013.

== Future Events

* CalConnect XXVII: June 3-7, 2013, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin
* CalConnect XXVIII: September 23-27, 2013, DHL Express, Prague, Czech Republic
* CalConnect XIX: Winter, 2014, TBD

The general format of the CalConnect week is:

* Monday morning through Wednesday noon, CalConnect Interoperability Test Event
* Wednesday noon through Friday afternoon, CalConnect Roundtable (presentations, TC sessions, BOFs, networking, Plenary)

This format has been altered for the two (so far) European CalConnect events to move all TC sessions to the afternoon and offer
symposia and BOFs during Thursday and Friday mornings.
