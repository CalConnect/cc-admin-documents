| 4.8.8.2 Request Status | `MAY` | the following is optional, and `MAY` occur more than once: xparam | Y | Y
| 6 Recommended Practices | `MUST NOT` | 2. A calendar entry with a "`DTSTART`" property but no "`DTEND`" property does not take up any time. It is intended to represent an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time of day, such as an anniversary. Since the event does not take up any time, it `MUST NOT` be used to record busy time no matter what the value for the "`TRANSP`" property. | Y | Y
| 6 Recommended Practices | `SHOULD` | 4. When the combination of the "`RRULE`" and "RDATE" properties on an iCalendar object produces multiple instances having the same start date/time, they should be collapsed to, and considered as, a single instance.  | Y | Y

In most cases this will be a `REQUEST` unless the "`VTODO`" has been cancelled, in which case the `ORGANIZER` `MUST` send a "`CANCEL`". This method is intended to facilitate machine processing of requests for updates to a "`VTODO`" calendar component. | N | N
| 3.4.7 `VTODO COUNTER` | `SHOULD` | The "Organizer" accepts the counter proposal by sending all of the "Attendees" of the "`VTODO`" calendar component a "`REQUEST`" method rescheduling the "`VTODO`" calendar component.

| 3.6 Status Replies | `MAY` | Various optional responses `MAY` be added to the various Status Replies to explain the particular Status value | Y | Y
| 3.7.2 Attendee Property Considerations | `MUST` | The "`ORGANIZER`" property is required on published events, to-dos, and journal entries for two reasons. First, only the "Organizer" is allowed to update and redistribute an event or to-do component. It follows that the "`ORGANIZER`" property `MUST` be present in the event, to-do, or journal entry component so that the CUA has a basis for authorizing an update. Second, it is prudent to provide a point of contact for anyone who receives a published component in case of problems. | Y | Y
| 3.7.2 Attendee Property Considerations | `MAY` | There are valid <rfc822>> addresses that represent groups. Sending email to such an address results in mail being sent to multiple recipients. Such an address may be used as the value of an "`ATTENDEE`" property. | Y | Y
| 3.7.2 Attendee Property Considerations | `MUST` a| Look for attendees where "`TYPE=GROUP`" or "`TYPE=UNKNOWN`". The CUA then determines if the "Calendar User" is a member of one of these groups. If so, the "`REPLY`" method sent to the "Organizer" `MUST` contain a new "`ATTENDEE`" property in which:

. the "type" property parameter is set to `INDIVIDUAL`
. the "member" property parameter is set to the name of the group | N | N

| 2.2.1 Authorization | `SHOULD` | Implementations of iMIP `SHOULD` verify the authenticity of the creator of an iCalendar object before taking any action. The methods for doing this are presented later in this document. | Y | Y
| 2.3 <<rfc822>> Addresses | `MUST` | The calendar address specified within the "`ATTENDEE`" property in an iCalendar object `MUST` be a fully qualified, <<rfc822>> address specification for the corresponding "Organizer" or "Attendee" of the "`VEVENT`" or "`VTODO`". | Y | Y
| 2.3 <<rfc822>> Addresses | `MUST` | The addresses of "Organizers" or "Attendees" `MUST` be ascertained by opening the "text/calendar" MIME body part and examining the "`ATTENDEE`" and "`ORGANIZER`" properties. | Y | N
| 2.4 Content Type | `MUST` | A MIME body part containing content information that conforms to this document `MUST` have an <<rfc2045>> "Content-Type" value of text/calendar". | Y | Y
| 2.4 Content Type | `MUST` | The <<rfc2045>> "Content-Type" header field must also include the type parameter "method". The value `MUST` be the same as the value of the "`METHOD`" calendar property within the iCalendar object. This means that a MIME message containing multiple iCalendar objects with different method values must be further encapsulated with a "multipart/mixed" MIME entity. This will allow each of the iCalendar objects to be encapsulated within their own "text/calendar" MIME entity. | Y | Y
| 2.4 Content Type | `MUST` | A "charset" parameter `MUST` be present if the iCalendar object contains characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set. <<rfc2046>> discusses the selection of an appropriate "charset" value. | Y | Y
| 2.4 Content Type | `SHOULD` | In order to permit the information in the scheduling message to be understood by MIME user agents (UA) that do not support the "text/calendar" content type, scheduling messages `SHOULD` be sent with an alternative, human-readable form of the information. | Y | Y
| 2.5 Content-Transfer-Encoding | `SHOULD` | A transfer encoding `SHOULD` be used for iCalendar objects containing any characters that are not part of the US-ASCII character set. | Y | Y
| 2.6 Content-Disposition | `SHOULD` | The handling of a MIME part should be based on its <<rfc2045>> "Content-Type". However, this is not guaranteed to work in all environments. Some environments handle MIME attachments based on their file type or extension. To operate correctly in these environments, implementations may wish to include a "Content-Disposition" property to define a file name. | Y | Y
