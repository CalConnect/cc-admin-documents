.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of
ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the

for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of any patent rights
identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction
and/or on the CalConnect list of patent declarations received (see

This document was prepared by Technical Committee _{technical-committee}_.

== Introduction

CalConnect Conference XXXV took place on January 13-15, 2016, hosted by AOL in
Palo Alto, California. The CalConnect Conference was attended by 21 people from 12
members and one non-member observer. The Interoperability Test Event was held
immediately prior to the Conference on January 11-13, 2016\5, and had 9 participants
onsite from 6 members.

The CalConnect Conference focused on sessions on strategic and possible work items
more than ongoing work, in accordance with our new format, and finished with the
CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The Conference agenda, with notes
on the discussion topics, may be found at CalConnect XXXV Schedule.

== Status of documents since last conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become
internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to become RFCs
(Proposed Standards), rather than be directly published by CalConnect itself.

=== Published Documents

* Report on CalConnect Conference XXXIV in Amsterdam, The Netherlands
* Report on Interoperability Test Event XXXIV

=== CalConnect Drafts in IETF Editor Queue to be Published as RFCs

* Time Zone Data Distribution Service
* CalDAV: Timezones by Reference

=== CalConnect Drafts in Progress at IETF Working Groups

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-availability/[Calendar Availability (VAVAILABILITY)]
* New Properties for iCalendar

=== CalConnect Drafts Pending Adoption by IETF Working Groups

* DAV Server Information Object
* Task Extensions to iCalendar

=== New and Updated CalConnect Drafts Submitted to the IETF

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-menderico-v-event-uri-00[v-event URI: An URI scheme for events]
* https://www.apple.com/[WebDAV: User Notifications]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing-03[WebDAV Resource Sharing]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-caldav-sharing-00[CalDAV Calendar Sharing]

== Technical Committee Work and Initiatives Going Forward

=== TC API

Work for Calconnect XXXVI includes an overall event object model and a new
"participant" model. Locations and alarms will be reviewed again. The goal is a public
release of the event model at CalConnect XXXVI.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Dormant pending progression of documents

=== TC CALDAV

* Move forward with iCalendar patch, focusing on "VPATCH" format rather than pathbased
format. Want to be able to use same format for all of patch/diff/compact use
cases.
* Write an I-D for new STRUCTURED-DATA iCalendar property
* Take direction from TC-API on how to implement multiple ORGANIZERs in iCalendar
* Work on private/protected/public properties

=== TC DEVGUIDE

* Create code examples to go along with Simple Event page
* Aim to publish a public version of the DEVGUIDE at CalConnect XXXVI and announce
the developer wiki
* See if the wiki can be hosted on the new CalConnect site
* Annotated version of RFC 5545 (iCalendar)

=== TC EVENTPUB

Rough consensus for CalConnect to create github-based schema set. Have concrete
set of categories to move forward with by next conference. Perhaps promote this for
CalConnect XXXVI and announce on CalDeveloper list.

=== TC FREEBUSY

Dormant

=== TC FSC

Define protocol for sharing (read-only and read-write) a single CalDAV calendar via an
"opaque" URL.

=== TC IOPTEST

Planning for CalConnect XXXVI.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

* Refresh current iSchedule draft as-is, punting on identity crisis and focusing on
enterprise-to-enterprise use
* Focus on improving iMIP - maybe in a new TC

=== TC PUSH

Dormant pending draft progression; interop testing ongoing

=== TC RESOURCE

Dormant pending draft progression at IETF

=== TC SHARING

* Determine what to do about scheduling/sharing interaction for caldav sharing
* Write a doc explaining differences between new sharing and Apple sharing and how to
be compatible with both
* Look again at contacts sharing

=== TC TASKS

Dormant pending draft progression at IETF

=== TC TIMEZONE

Dormant pending publication of drafts as RFCs. The TC may reactivate thereafter to
consider promotion of implementations of the TZ data distribution service.

== Plenary Decisions

TC IMIP will be established to pursue improving interoperability with iMIP and
enhancing the user experience, as extending iSchedule for general usage has proven
improbable due to the "identity crisis".

== Future Events

* CalConnect XXXVI: April 18-22, 2016, Ribose/OGCIO, Hong Kong
* CalConnect XXXVII: September 12-16 2016, SmoothSync, Dresden, Germany
* CalConnect XXXVIII: Winter 2017 TBD
* CalConnect XXXIX: May 2017, Tandem, Seattle, Washington

The general format of the CalConnect Week is:

* Monday morning through Wednesday noon, CalConnect Interoperability Test Event
* Wednesday noon through Friday afternoon, CalConnect Conference (presentations, TC
sessions, BOFs, networking, Plenary)
