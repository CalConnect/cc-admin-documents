.Foreword

This proposal was submitted to the IETF as an Internet Draft for the Standards Track on
4 June 2009, and was published by the IETF as RFC 6321 on 8 August 2011. It may be
found at the following URL:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6321

The purpose of this specification is to define an XML format that allows iCalendar data
to be converted to XML, and then back to iCalendar, without losing any semantic meaning
in the data. Anyone creating XML calendar data according to this specification will
know that their data can be converted to a valid iCalendar representation as well.
