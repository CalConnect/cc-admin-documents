== Introduction

The second CalConnect Mobile Calendaring interoperability event was held at the Kerio campus
at Plzen, Czech Republic. This was also our first interoperability event held in Europe.
Participants of the testing event used predetermined test scenarios. Rather than post the full
scenarios in this document, they can be found on the CalConnect website at the following URL:
http://www.calconnect.org/ioptesting.shtml.

The testing scenarios used in this event were a subset of items found in the CalConnect Mobile
Calendaring Test Suite. Summaries and specific findings and issues found are noted in this
document. The items used in the subset are included in this document in <<appendix-A>>.

== Testing Results

The following reflects general items noted during the testing. The subset used during testing was
comprised of 111 scenarios of which 52 were classified as easy, 42 as medium and 17 as hard.
During testing, 781 test responses were noted. The breakdown of the tests was as follows:

Easy tests:: 210 passed, 33 failed, 1 was noted as "half pass" and 120 were skipped.
Medium tests:: 138 passed, 29 failed, 3 "half passed" and 118 were skipped.
Hard tests:: 31 passed, 17 failed, 1 "half passed" and 70 were skipped.

Therefore, 49% of the tests passed, 11% failed, 39% were skipped and .06% half-passed.
Considering the fact that only 27% of the tests performed were deemed "easy", a 49% pass ratio
is good, but not as good as the numbers could be.

Lack of support on client or server applications was the primary reason tests failed. There were a
few bugs noted. Occasional failures were because of differences in the level of support for
vCalendar formats.

== Testing Tables

The following tables show results found during testing. The names of the testing pairs have been
removed to provide a generic idea of findings.

| Test ID | Status | Comments

| 1.1 Create an Event with a Reminder | Pass | 
| 1.2 Access Level and Priority | Pass | Passed, showing privacy status when syncing from server, then after removal of private and synced back, correct behaviour was seen on server. Could not test priority. Issue in vendor calendar test app with all day events - we believe this is the test app and not the calendar database engine.
| 1.3 Special Characters From Server | Fail | Generally successful but failed on handling "&" -- was converted to the html entity "&amp;" and then not handled correctly.
| 1.4 Multi-Byte Characters From Server | Fail | Chinese characters not shown correctly on web client and device
| 1.5 Deletion | Pass |
| 1.6 Create an Event with a Reminder | Pass |
| 1.7 Access Level and Priority (can only be done if device supports setting an access level or priority) | Pass |

| 2.4 Create an anniversary all-day event | Pass | Tested with regular yearly recurrence (proprietary vCalendar extension property used by client to flag anniversaries)
| 2.5 All-day event on last day of month & last day of year check | Pass |
| 2.6 Create a Single Instance Holiday with Reminder | | n/a, both sides don't have special "holiday" entry type
| 2.7 Update an all-day event on server and synchronize back to mobile device in same time zone | Pass |
| 2.8 Update an all-day event on server and synchronize back to a device in different time zone | Pass |
| 2.9 Create a Single Instance Multi-day Day Event | Pass | but definition of what an ALL-DAY event actually IS is different in the device (binds day to current device zone) and server (considers all-day floating, i.e. not moving when TZ changes)
| 2.10 Remove Single Instance Meeting, Day Event, and Holiday | Pass |
| 2.11 Create an all-day event and synchronize to a server in same time zone | Pass | but device fixes start and end in time (see comment fo 2.9)
| 2.12 Create an all-day event and synchronize to a server in different time zone | Fail | see comment in 2.9 (comes out fixed in UTC-5 time, which is not all-day in GMT server time)
| 2.13 Create a Single Instance All Day Event with Reminder | Pass |
| 2.14 Create an anniversary all-day event | Pass | Anniversaries are in fact floating time, which is IMHO what all-day events should be as well
| 2.15 Update an all-day event on mobile device and synchronize back to server in same time zone | Pass |
| 2.16 Update an all-day event on mobile device and synchronize back to a server in different time zone | Pass | But generally: synchronizing modified anniversary back to device will make loose the anniversary status on the device (because it would need proprietary vCalendar extension property to remain anniversary)

| 3.43 Modify anniversary | Pass |
| 3.44 Modify occurrences of repeating meeting | Pass | But we think test case is not very useful because this does not really test exceptions (it simply changes the recurrence end date) - we should have a case actually testing modifying exception details like time, summary, location.

== Summary

The first mobile event found the test suite had too many scenarios to test during one event.
Therefore, this time we tested only a subset of the scenarios and this proved to be the right thing
to do. Participants were able to get through all the scenarios and provide commentary. It was
found that there were some things tested that appeared to be redundant. Gregory Pekofsky put
together a document that provides suggestions on how to streamline the limited subset so we can
better utilize our valuable testing time. His suggested are noted in Appendix B at the end of this
document.

As usual, participants found that sitting in a room together and doing live testing was extremely
useful. The facilities were perfect and connectivity, always an issue when doing mobile testing,
was excellent.

We extend our thanks and appreciation to Kerio for providing with us with an excellent testing
environment and very helpful and professional staff. We also thank the participants for their time
in helping us further interoperability among mobile devices and calendaring.

Respectfully submitted by Patricia Egen.
