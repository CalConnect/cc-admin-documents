.Foreword

CalConnect Conference XXXII took place on January 28-30, 2015, hosted by Kerio Technologies in San Jose, California. The CalConnect
Conference was attended by 37 people from 17 members, and two non-member observers. The Conference also included our Tenth Anniversary
Celebration, which was held on Wednesday afternoon the 28th, with the regular conference then on Thursday and Friday the 29th and 30th. The
Tenth Anniversary Celebration on Wednesday afternoon also attracted 12 additional people who came only for the celebration. The Interoperability
Test Event was held immediately prior to the Conference on January 26-28, 2015, and had 24 participants onsite from 13 members and 1 nonmember.
In total, 53 people from 20 organizations attended some portion of the week (not counting organizations who came only for the
Celebration on Wednesday).

At this Conference we also implemented our first effort at redesigning the CalConnect Conference to provide sessions of broader interest. Instead
of our usual Technical Committee sessions, workshops and BOFs, several sessions on broader topics and at a higher level were offered, with the
intent of providing more value to our participants. Some of the very detailed discussions formerly part of a conference TC session were moved to
earlier in the week, during the Interoperability Test Event. The Conference finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The
Conference agenda, with notes on the discussion topics, may be found at CalConnect XXXII Schedule.

== CalConnect tenth anniversary celebration

Wednesday afternoon was dedicated to our Tenth Anniversary Celebration; our first real members' meeting was held in January of 2005 at the
University of Washington. We had a number of invited guests in addition to the participants attending the regular CalConnect Conference. Special
session for the Celebration included the History of CalConnect; The Freebusy Challenge; Calendaring as a Platform; and a panel discussion in the
Future of Calendaring, plus guest speakers Lisa Dusseault, the originator of CalDAV, who spoke on committee standards development, and Steve
Allen from the University of California Lick Observatory, who spoke on "The Time People Want", an exploration of the history and management of
time and time zones. More about the Tenth Anniversary Celebration may be found at CalConnect Tenth Anniversary.

== Documents since last conference

_Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to become RFCs (Proposed
Standards), rather than be directly published by CalConnect itself._

== Update on technical committee work and initiatives

=== CALSCALE Ad Hoc

The Ad Hoc is in abeyance while
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-rscale/[Non-Gregorian Recurrence Rules in iCalendar (RSCALE)]
completes progression through the IETF to become an
RFC; the document is undergoing AD Review prior to an IETF last call. The Ad Hoc will disband when the document is accepted as a Proposed
Standard unless further work is identified.

=== TC API

TC API has been focused on developing generic calendaring API making it easy to develop simple and more complex apps which access calendar
store via generic APIs. In addition to continuing with this work, TC API will sponsor a discussion of creating a new activity to develop guidance for
developers and users of calendaring specifications, possibly including an iCalendar data model, developers' guide for iCalendar or CalDAV, and so
forth.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

The TC has produced an initial draft of a mechanism for multiple service discovery via a single protocol for client setup and submitted to the IETF:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-daboo-aggregated-service-discovery/[Aggregated Service Discovery].
The TC is now dormant waiting for an opportunity to move this forward at the IETF. Some interoperability testing of
this specification occurred during the interoperability test event this week.

=== TC CALDAV

Work over last 4 months:

* Scheduling Drafts - Worked designing on a mechanism for creating drafts of scheduling objects which allows event/tasks to be created
without automatic scheduling operations being performed by the server until the organizer "commits" the draft as ready for scheduling. The
current design is as follows:
** Drafts are stored as resources in calendar collections using a specific DAV:resourcetype value (NOT in a single "drafts" collection)
** To create a draft: POST /;add-member - server returns location of created draft
** To "commit" a draft: POST //?action=create - server deletes the draft and adds a new non-draft resource (it may use the same URI/UID
or a different one - location is returned)
** Open issue on how to specify draft DAV:resourcetype at creation time - three possibilities:
... Use a query parameter on the POST URL, e.g. ?resourcetype=calendar-draft
... Use a header field in the POST request, e.g. DAV-resourcetype: calendar-draft
... Use a multipart media type for the POST body that combines PUT+PROPPATCH to do atomic setting of WebDAV properties and
resource body all in one go, e.g. "multipart/webdav-resource" with the first part being application/xml (WebDAV PROPPATCH
body) and the second part being the data for the resource body.
** A mechanism for creating drafts from existing events was discussed and tabled as future work
* Server Information Document (Rich Capabilities) - Worked on designing a structured resource to organize the DAV services and features
available on a server to replace the already bloated DAV response header field. The current design is as follows:
** The resource will be an XML document containing elements describing one or more "services", e.g. CalDAV, CardDAV, generic
WebDAV
** Each "service" element will contain elements describing one or more "features" of that service, e.g. DAV level 1, calendar-access,
sharing, etc
** Open issue on how to list DAV features present in all services - two possibilities:
... List global "features" at the top of the XML document outside of any "services"
... List the global "features" inside a specially named "service", e.g. "*"
** A mechanism for including global/constant-valued DAV properties was discussed and tabled as future work

Work for the next four months:
** How to handle visibility of drafts by non-draft-aware clients? Keep resource-type as calendar?
** More ioptesting on managed attachments, especially attachments on recurrences
** Make managed attachments spec depend on server info document - probably requires revisiting including global/static/constant
properties
** Move WebDAV Prefer through IETF
** Generate a client/server capability matrix for publication

=== TC EVENTPUB

The TC has been dormant as we wait for the backlog of drafts before the IETF to clear. The current EVENTPUB drafts referenced above are
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-douglass-calendar-extension/[Event Publication Extensions to iCalendar]
and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-daboo-icalendar-extensions[New Properties for iCalendar].
Over the next few months the TC will be reactivated to consider
and develop a proposal to add QRCODES to Calendar URIs.

=== TC FREEBUSY

The TC has been working on the VPOLL specification:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-york-vpoll-00[VPOLL: Consensus Scheduling Component for iCalendar]. The major change was the
introduction of a VVOTER component to carry more complex information about voters and their choices, driven by the need to provide more
information for task assignment - e.g. cost, expected time, possible start times etc. Over the next few months the TC will plan for
interoperability testing on how non-aware VPOLL clients handle VPOLL in a collection

=== TC FSC

TC FSC (Federated Shared Calendars) has been working on the invitation flow for shared calendars and published calendars (e.g. enhanced
webcal) and will continue its work in this area. It is jointly working with TC SHARING to resolve ambiguities in how invitations are managed
and sharing is handled in different circumstances.

=== TC IOPTEST

Conducted general CalDAV and CardDAV testing. Some testing started of CalDAV PUSH and sharing. Much iMIP testing as Microsoft
participated in the test event. During the Interop, breakout sessions were held on iMIP, PUSH, and QRCOCDES and the URI. A new
specification for the iMIP header will be developed and submitted to the IETF. The event report may be found at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/event-reports#ioptestevents[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event Reports] once completed.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

iSchedule was dormant over the last four months but will be reactivated after this conference. Its work for the next 4 months will be:

* Define iSchedule: URL scheme (in lieu of mailto or other schemes)
* Postpone "identity crisis" issue for the time being
* Determine if we need a form of redirect/forward in the base iSchedule specification
* Get the current draft with these changes adopted as an IETF working group draft

=== TC PUSH

The TC has developed a first version of a push protocol. It provides methods to subscribe to topics and to deliver push messages to a new
entity called push-gateway. The push gateway acts as an adapter to the actual push delivery service and provides a standardized interface to
the application server. The TC also specified an extension to WebDAV to provide a way for the client to discover supported push-gateways,
to discover push topics and to subscribe to topics and select a specific gateway. At this time there is an initial implementation of a pushgateway
as well as server side and client side implementations.

Work for next 4 months:

* Finish the initial specs
* Get more clients & servers to implement the draft
* Plan for more Interop testing at the next event

=== TC RESOURCE

TC RESOURCE is dormant, waiting on its drafts to begin progression at the IETF.

=== TC SHARING

The base specifications for webdav resource sharing and webdav notifications have been published to the IETF"
https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing[WebDAV Resource Sharing]
and WebDAV Notifications. Work will now begin on CalDAV Calendar Sharing and CardDAV Address Book Sharing. The calendar sharing
specification should be relatively straight-forward. Some unanswered questions remain regarding address book sharing of Collections vs.
Groups. Will address private events in CalDAV sharing.

Work for next 4 months:

* Finish up CalDAV sharing
* Start CardDAV sharing

=== TC TASKS

Over the last four months the TC completed work on two specifications. The Tasks Extensions draft was submitted to the IETF as an Internet
Draft; iCalendar Relationships was updated at the IETF to reflect the work of the TC. The Task Extensions draft defines the actual
enhancements to VTODOs that are the primary goal of the TC.

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-apthorp-ical-tasks/[Task Extensions to iCalendar]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-douglass-ical-relations/[Improved Support for iCalendar Relations]

Work for next 4 months:

* Clarify issues with URI vs ID tokens
* Task recurrences? Regeneration?
* Time sensitive tasks?
* Interop planning

=== TC TIMEZONE

The TC is on hold pending the progression of its two drafts at the IETF via the 
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-tzdist/[TZDIST Working Group]:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tzdist-caldav-timezone-ref/[Time Zone Data Distribution Service]
and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tzdist-caldav-timezone-ref/[CalDAV: Timezones by Reference].
The Time Zone Data Distribution Service draft is now in working group last call; the Time Zones by
Reference draft has been accepted as a working group draft.
