== Introduction

CalConnect XXXVI took place on April 18-22, 2016, hosted by Ribose and OGCIO in Hong Kong,
as part of a larger event, the Hong Kong 2016 ITFEST. In addition to our regular conference
and test event, we held a seminar at Hong Kong University, and a Public Day at the
Hong Kong Convention Center on Wednesday. The CalConnect Test Event (Monday and
Tuesday) and Conference (Thursday and Friday) were held at the Cyberport, about 20
minutes from central Hong Kong.

The CalConnect Conference was attended by 22 people from 15 members, plus 7
observers. The Test Event was held on April 18-19, 2016, and had 13 participants from
9 members, plus 2 observers.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items more than ongoing work,
in accordance with our new format, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session
on Friday afternoon. The Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be
found at CalConnect XXXVI Conference Schedule.

== Status of documents since last conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become
internet draft submissions to the IEETF and ultimately be progressed to publication
as RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than directly published by CalConnect itself.

=== Published Documents
* Report on CalConnect Conference XXXV in Palo Alto, California
* Report on Interoperability Test Event XXXV

=== CalConnect Specifications Published as RFCs
* RFC 7808 Time Zone Data Distribution Service
* RFC 7809 CalDAV: Time Zones By Reference

=== CalConnect Drafts completed IETF WG Last Call
* New Properties for iCalendar
* Calendar Availability (VAVAILABILITY)

=== New and Updated CalConnect Drafts at the IETF
* v-event URI: A URI scheme for events
* WebDAV User Notifications
* WebDAV Resource Sharing
* CalCOnnect Calendar Sharing

== Technical Committee Work and Initiatives Going Forward

=== TC API

Working on a new key/value based data model. Much of the work is done and the
remainder will continue.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Will be reactivated to consider authorization issues.

=== TC CALDAV

* Created initial draft of STRUCTURED-DATA iCalendar property - allows schema-based
data to be included with an event/task

* Created rough draft for scoped attendee parameters - allows control of which
parameter(s) are sent in scheduling messages - initial draft in progress

* Working on iCalendar-based patch/diff format - initial draft in progress

=== TC DEVGUIDE

Basic content for a single event is complete along with some other material.
DEVGUIDE has been styled to fit with he CalConnect web site in appearance.

=== TC EVENTPUB

Reviewed DMOZ directory service as source of categorization but it doesn't provide
all the needed info. Will continue with editing approach of providing a web service
to search and retrieve categories, but not invent something ourselves.

=== TC FREEBUSY

Dormant

=== TC FSC

To be merged into TC SHARING.

=== TC IMIP

Investigating how/why particular MIME formats are used by vendors, in particular
application/ics content-type.

=== TC IOPTEST

Conducted Interoperability Testing at CalConnect XXXVI. Looking at rebranding the
test event as Developer's Forum.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

Dormant. Specification is essentially complete but pending on other specs at the IETF
which have a higher priority.

=== TC PUSH

Draft to be published to the IETF after CalConnect XXXVI.

=== TC RESOURCE

Dormant

=== TC SHARING

Specifications completed over the last few weeks. Need to get some implementations
and do some testing. New CalDAV tester tests would help. TC-Sharing will take on the
work of coming up with a subscription model. How to upgrade subscriptions to
something more efficient than periodic polling of an ics file.

=== TC TASKS

Dormant

=== TC TIMEZONE

RFCs 7808 and 7809 published. Closed by decision of CalConnect Plenary XXXVI.

== Special Events

On Tuesday evening, CalConnect offered a 2-hour seminar at Hong Kong University. On
Wednesday, CalConnect held an all-day Public Day as part of the Hong Kong 2016
ITFEST, at the Hong Kong Convention Centre. More about these events may be found at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-public-day-hong-kong-it-fest[Public Day]
and https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-seminar-hong-kong-university[Seminar].

== Plenary Decisions

* Developer's Guide announcement to be done after How to Contribute and Introduction
sections added

* Rebrand Interoperability Test Event as Developer's Forum to reflect model of both
testing and in-depth technical discussions

* Close TC TIMEZONE

* Provisional Committees PC QR (QRCODE include vCard info) and PC SEC (Security and
Encryption) established, to report out at CalConnect XXXVII

* TC AUTODISCOVERY will be reactivated

== Future Events

* CalConnect XXXVII: September 12-16, 2016 - dmfs, Dresden, Germany
* CalConnect XXXVIII: February 13-17, 2017 - University of California, Irvine,
California
* CalConnect XXXIX: May 2017 - Tandem, Seattle, Washington
* CalConnect XXXX - Autumn 2017 - TBD

The general format of the CalConnect Week is:

* Monday morning through Wednesday noon, Developer's Forum (testing, tech discussions)
* Wednesday noon through Friday afternoon, Conference
