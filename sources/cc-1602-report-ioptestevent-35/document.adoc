.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of
ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the
editorial rules of the CalConnect Directives.

== Report

The CalConnect interoperability event was hosted by AOL at their Palo Alto site on
January 11th through the morning of the 13th.

While it was a smaller than usual event much valuable work took place. There was the
usual mix of in-depth discussions and actual testing of implementations.

On the testing front there was:

* Work on the server-info document
* CalDav Tester
* Ralph Beckers CalDAV tester scripts
* General CalDAV

The server-info document is a new specification being developed to provide cacheable
server information for use by clients, detailing services available and some limits.
This has been implemented by a number of servers and some clients. Each
interoperability event has led to changes in the specification. The general feeling
is that it is now ready for wider testing and use.

The CalDAV tester is associated with Apple's Darwin open source server offering and
provides many tests of CardDAV, CalDAV and related features. It is very configurable.
Ralph Becker's tool helps to run the tests and store results.

While historically, this has been an event focusing on interoperability testing we
have been moving towards having more in-depth, developer-centric discussions on
topics of interest.

This event was no exception with discussions on all of the above topics as well as
how best to move forward with the new developers guide.

We are looking forward to being back to our usual larger attendance at Hong Kong in
April. Check the website over the coming weeks as we will be updating the schedule to
reflect the specific interests of the attendees.
