[heading=terms and definitions]
== Definitions

=== Calendar
A collection of events, tasks, journal entries, etc.
Examples include a person's or group's schedule,
resource availability, and event listings.

=== Scheduling
The exchange of request/invitations and
responses between organizers and attendees of
scheduled events, tasks or journal entries.

=== CalConnect
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium,
consisting of vendors and user groups interested
in promoting and improving calendaring and
scheduling [underline]#standards and interoperability#.

== Why CalConnect was established

=== 1995-1999

* 1996 Versit Consortium issued vCalendar
specification
* 199x IETF CALSCH working group started
on iCalendar specification
* 1998 iCalendar (RFC 2445), iTIP (RFC 2446)
and iMIP (RFC 2447) became a proposed
standard
* 199x Work began on draft for Calendaring
Access Protocol (CAP)
* 1998 -- 2000 Some interoperability testing

=== 2000-2004

* Work on CAP -- stopped
* Interoperability testing -- stopped
* Work on iCalendar, iTIP and iMIP -- stopped
* IETF CALSCH working group -- stopped
* *The draft RFCs were not ready*
** Too ambiguous
** Too complex
** Untested
* Calendaring and Scheduling Vendors
continued to use the RFCs as they could
* Where the RFCs were inadequate vendors
were forced to develop workarounds or
unique extensions
* Work on follow-on or related specifications
was hampered by being "built on sand"
* Vendors -- and users -- became more and
more frustrated by the lack of movement in
calendaring standards and interoperability
* Interoperability between calendaring
systems was mostly still a dream
* Somewhere around 2004 things started to
move again
* Some vendors began moving towards
alternatives to the base RFCs
* Interoperability seemed less important than
progressing products
* Work was begun on CalDAV as a
prospective standard for a calendar access
protocol, recognizing that CAP was a dead
end

=== Establishment of CalConnect

CalConnect was founded in January of
2004 to promote interoperable
Calendaring and Scheduling.

[quote]
The driving premise behind the Consortium is that
interoperability between calendaring programs and
systems is essential to achieving the promise and
future growth of calendaring.

[quote]
We believe that our work towards interoperability is a
major factor driving the future of internet
calendaring, and are actively working to involve
significant players (vendors and customers) in the
calendaring arena.

=== Why a Consortium?

A focused environment to:

* Re-energize Calendaring and Scheduling
* Provide a forum to discuss the direction for
standards and implementations
* Validate the existing standards
* Provide interoperability testing between
implementations and against standards
* Drive requirements for changes to existing
standards, new and complementary standards
back into IETF, other bodies
* Where necessary develop initial specifications and
submit them to SDOs for progression to standards
* Promote standards and technologies to the vendor
and user communities

== Overview of CalConnect

=== What is CalConnect?

A Partnership between Calendaring &
Scheduling Vendors and Customers

* To provide a general understanding of, promote,
and provide mechanisms so that Calendaring and
Scheduling methodologies, tools and applications
can enter the mainstream of computing

Not a standards development organization
(SDO)

* Develop use cases, requirements, papers, specs
* Promote development and adoption of standards
* Introduce specifications into SDOs for progression
* Influence SDOs and vendors

=== The Vision

[quote,"Dave Thewlis, CalConnect Executive Director"]
Our vision of the future is not only
interoperable calendaring, but ubiquitous
interoperable calendaring. Calendaring
should--and can--be as ubiquitous as
electronic mail.

[quote,"Pamela Taylor, CalConnect Board Member"]
Being able to schedule meetings with my
work group is important. But being able to
schedule an appointment with my
hairdresser could change the world.

== The Current State of Calendaring Standards

=== Calendaring Standards Today

==== [strike]#IETF CALSCH Working Group#

* [strike]#Developed RFCs 2445/6/7#
* [strike]#Shut down in 2004 at same time as CAP removed from table#

==== [strike]#Original CAP (Calendar Access Protocol)#

* [strike]#Assigned "experimental draft" status by IETF in 2004 (effectively removed from program of work in IETF)#

==== [strike]#vCalendar#

* [strike]#Still in use especially in mobile calendaring, travel industry websites#
* [strike]#Not fully compatible with iCalendar (e.g. recurrence); encourage move to iCalendar#
* https://www.calconnect.org/publications/iCalendarforthemobileindustryv1.0.pdf[The Benefits of iCalendar for the Mobile Industry]

==== vCard

* Not precisely "calendaring" -- but contacts/address
book central to calendaring
* Current version 3.0 needs work
* Mobile calendaring mostly obsolete vCard 2.1
* https://www.calconnect.org/vcardworkshopreport.shtml[CalConnect vCard workshop]

==== IETF "CALSIFY" Working Group

* Simplify (rationalize) RFCs 2445/6/7

==== RFCs 2445/6/7 (iCalendar, iTIP, iMIP)

* Target of initial CalConnect work products
* All have revised drafts underway
* Expect publication of revised RFCs in 2008
* Still require interoperability demonstration to
progress to Draft Standards (i.e. CalConnect)

==== CalDAV

* "Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV" published as
Proposed Standard, RFC 4791
* "Scheduling Extensions to CalDAV" is under
review for submission
* Several CalDAV implementations today
** Apple iCal Server (Darwin Calendar Server)
** Bedework
** Evolution
** Kerio Technologies (Kerio MailServer)
** Marware (Project X Client)
** Mozilla Lightning & Sunbird (CalDAV client)
** Mulberry (Client)
** Oracle Calendar
** OSAF Cosmo (Chandler Project)
** Etc.

==== iCalendar Extensions

* Proposed extensions (additions) to the revised
iCalendar when it is complete
* VAVAILABILITY
** New iCalendar component allowing publication of available
and unavailable time periods associated with calendar user
* VVENUE
** New iCalendar component allowing the specification of
structured location data for publishing event information

==== EVENTMAP protocol

* Identifies location on website of structured event
information for use by event publication
aggregators
