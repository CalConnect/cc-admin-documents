== Introduction

CalConnect Conference XXXIV took place on September 30 - October 2, 2015, hosted by Gershon Janssen in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
The CalConnect Conference was attended by 30 people from 17 members and one non-member observer. The Interoperability Test Event
was held immediately prior to the Conference on September 28-30, 2015, and had 13 participants onsite from 10 members.

At this Conference we again used our redesigned CalConnect Conference format, originally tried at the January 2015 Conference, to provide
sessions of broader interest. Instead of our usual Technical Committee sessions, workshops and BOFs, several sessions on broader topics
and at a higher level were offered, with the intent of providing more value to our participants. Some of the very detailed discussions formerly
part of a conference TC session were moved to earlier in the week, during the Interoperability Test Event. The Conference finished with the
CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The Conference agenda, with notes on the discussion topics, may be found at CalConnect
XXXIV Schedule.

== Documents since Last Conference

_Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to become RFCs
(Proposed Standards), rather than be directly published by CalConnect itself._

=== Published Documents

* Report on CalConnect Conference XXXIII in Bucharest, Romania
* Report on Interoperability Test Event XXXIII

=== CalConnect Drafts Published as RFCs by the IETF

* RFC 7529, https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7529[Non-Gregorian Recurrence Rules in iCalendar (RSCALE)].

=== CalConnect Drafts in IETF Editor Queue to be Published as RFCs:

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tzdist-service/[Time Zone Data Distribution Service]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tzdist-caldav-timezone-ref//[CalDAV: Timezones by Reference]

=== CalConnect Drafts in Progress at IETF Working Groups:

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-availability/[Calendar Availability (VAVAILABILITY)]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-calext-extensions/[New Properties for iCalendar]

=== Updated CalConnect Drafts Pending Adoption by IETF Working Groups:

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-douglass-server-info/[DAV Server Information Object]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-apthorp-ical-tasks/[Task Extensions to iCalendar]

_Please note that CalConnect documents at the IETF are mentioned only if their status has changed or they have been updated since the last
CalConnect event_

== Update on Technical Committee Work and Initiatives

=== TC API

Discussed various API formats and attempted to come to an agreement on how a such API would look. The group is split on using a slightly
more stream based API like JMAP and using a REST based API. Possible formats for the data exchange are JMAP and HAL among others.
Now comparing various data formats already in use (Caligrah vs JMAP vs iCalendar vs Microsoft) to detect similarities. During the next
period the TC will develop the "simple" JSON data model specification and look at models for scheduling and recurrences.

=== TC CALDAV

Focused mainly on server-info-document
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-douglass-server-info/[DAV Server Information Object]
and we seem to be getting close to something that is fully baked.
Format has been solid for a while. We now have a mechanism for the client to detect a change in the server-info-token via HTTP responses.
Ken has uploaded his server capabilities spreadsheet for our GitHub repository as a staring point for accumulating this info from our
members/vendors. During the next months the server-info document will be finalized. The TC will work on the server/client features matrix
and integration with DEVGUIDE. The icalendar-patch draft will be reviewed.

=== TC DEVGUIDE

Talked about the format of the guide, agreed on using gollum wiki and set it up with the new CalConnect github account. Some initial content
has been added. During the next months the TC will work on "examples" content, formatting and layout, and X-properties descriptions.

=== TC EVENTPUB

The TC completed work on the QRCODE/Data URI proposal and a draft specification is being developed, to be submitted to the IETF when
ready.

=== TC FREEBUSY

Mostly on hold as we try to get other specifications through the IETF. VAVAILABILITY is ready and VPOLL needs more work but is
implementable, much interest from the SmartGrid and from LegalXML. Had some discussions on other poll modes, in particular signup (for
social calendaring). Task assignment is also on the list.

=== TC FSC

TC FSC (Federated Shared Calendars) reviewed the invite process taking into consideration that federated sharing involves not just
calendars but at least contacts and possibly more. The issue of security is becoming more important and there is more interest in end-to-end
signing and encryption. This obviously has implications for server side services that need access to the content to function - for example
scheduling and alarms. The issue of key escrow was raised - in some circumstances (companies and their employees) it is a requirement
that the employer has a copy of the keys. This would allow encryption services to run with server side decryption. Planning to hold joint calls
with TC ISCHEDULE as we are talkking about some of the same issues.

=== TC IOPTEST

The TC planned for and conducted the interop testing event at CalConnect XXXIV, reported on at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/event-reports#ioptestevents[CalConnect Interoperability Test Event Reports].
The TC will now begin planning for the testing at CalConnect XXXV in January.

=== TC ISCHEDULE

TC ISCHEDULE is waiting for the IETF TZDIST working group to conclude, then propose rechartering it to deal with the iSchedule draft. Joint
calls between TC ISCHEDULE and TC FSC will be initiated as the two TCs are dealing with some of the same issues.

=== TC PUSH

We clarified a few open issues with the protocol and discussed how to proceed with the submission to the IETF. The TC is also waiting for
more implementations to begin more extensive testing.

=== TC RESOURCE

TC RESOURCE is dormant, waiting on its drafts to begin progression at the IETF.

=== TC SHARING

The base specifications for webdav resource sharing and webdav notifications have been published to the IETF: https://tools.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-pot-webdav-resource-sharing[WebDAV Resource Sharing]
and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pot-webdav-notifications[WebDAV Notifications].
The TC has been working on getting an implementation ready to go, and the first two specs have been partially
implemented. Working through this allowed us to find a number of issues with the spec, so we've published new drafts. We added a
{DAV:}share-mode property and removed the {DAV:}resourcetype semantics.

=== TC TASKS

The Task Extensions draft has been updated, and the TC is looking at some form of tasks taxonomy.

* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-apthorp-ical-tasks/[Task Extensions to iCalendar]
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-douglass-ical-relations/[Improved Support for iCalendar Relations]

=== TC TIMEZONE

The TC is on hold pending the progression of its two drafts at the IETF, both of which have completed IETF Last Call and are now in the
Editor Queue pending publications as RFCs. The TC will reactivate to discuss the promotion of the Timezone Data Distribution Service and
its incorporation into production systems.

== Future Events

* CalConnect XXXV: January 25-29, 2016, AOL, Palo Alto, California
* CalConnect XXXVI: April 18-22, 2016, Ribose/OGCIO, Hong Kong

The general format of the CalConnect week is:

* Monday morning through Wednesday noon, CalConnect Interoperability Test Event
* Wednesday noon through Friday afternoon, CalConnect Conference (presentations, TC sessions, BOFs, networking, Plenary)
* The format for European events is to move TC sessions to the afternoon, offer symposia and BOFs during Thursday and Friday mornings,
and continue through Friday afternoon.
