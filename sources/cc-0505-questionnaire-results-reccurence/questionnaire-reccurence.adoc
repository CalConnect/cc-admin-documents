== Questionnaire on Implementation of Recurrence

////
EDITOR: Document attributes are not available for this document.
////

The Recurrence Technical Committee of the Consortium is collecting specific
information on how calendaring and scheduling
implementations have implemented or not implemented the recurrence rules of iCalendar
as part of its work to compile actual usage
information and develop recommendations to CalSIFY and other efforts.

This questionnaire is *NOT* limited to Consortium members; we need information from
as many different implementations as possible.
We appreciate your responding to this questionnaire with as much information about
your implementation as you can. If you do not
know whether the response to an individual rule instance is "Yes" or "No" please
leave the response blank. We welcome as much
information as you are able and willing to supply. If we have questions or are
unclear about your responses we will contact you via the
e-mail address you supply.

Our goal is to obtain a broad perspective on how recurrence has been dealt with in
existing implementations. The final report which the
Consortium will make public will not identify any particular product or
implementation, nor will it present the results in a way which
will allow such inferences to be made.

=== Part 1. Product/Implementation being reported

Please specify the product or implementation name, your name, and your e-mail
address. We will contact you via e-mail if we have any questions or are
unclear about any of your responses.

Product/Implementation Name::
Name of Person Reporting::
E-Mail Address:: &nbsp;

=== Part 2. Specific Implementation Information

This table contains elements for specific rules from RFC 2445. For each one, please
indicate whether the implementation does (Yes) or does not (No)
conform to the stated rule. If you have comments, issues or questions about this rule
please enter in the Comment line under the rule.

NOTE: The ``MUST``s, ``MUST NOT``s, etc. in the specs refer to both consumption and
production of the relevant items. To be compliant you have to do both
correctly. So for the purposes of the questionnaire please answer YES only if you
both produce and consume the item correctly (or if your
implementation only does one thing - i.e. just consumes - then answer YES to that if
it conforms). Ignore any behavior for non-compliant data being
consumed.

NOTE: If you cannot reasonably answer either Yes or No to a question, please respond
"Other" and explain the problem or situation in the comment line
(or, if the statement is too long for the comment line, in the comment area at the
end of the form.

| 3.4.5.b `VTODO CANCEL`

&#9675; Yes &#9675; No &#9675; Other

In most cases this will be a `REQUEST` unless the "`VTODO`" has been cancelled, in which case the `ORGANIZER` must send a "`CANCEL`". This method is intended to facilitate machine processing of requests for updates to a "`VTODO`" calendar component.

=== Part 3. Additional Comments or Issues with Recurrences

Please use the following area{blank}footnote:[If your comments are likely to be long,
please send them by e-mail to Dave.Thewlis@calconnect.org and reference the
questionnaire response to which they belong.] to provide any additional comments or
issues with recurrences that may not be addressed above; known interop issues with
a particular other implementation that might conflict with your implementation; etc.

=== Part 4. Feedback on Value of this Questionnaire

We would appreciate your feedback on this questionnaire. Specifically, (1) Would you
like to see a similar questionnaire for all of RFCs 2445 and 2446
(knowing that it would be quite large). (2) Was it worthwhile for you to fill this
out in the sense that it allows you to compare your implementation to the
proposed standards? (3) Can you offer us any additional comments to help us do better
in the future?

=== Part 5. Completion and Submission

Please review your completed questionnaire carefully. You may use the "CLEAR" button
below to clear the entire form and re-enter all information. Use
the "SEND" button to transmit the completed questionnaire to us.
