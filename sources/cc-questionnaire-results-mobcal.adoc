== Introduction

The Mobile Technical Committee of the Calendaring & Scheduling Consortium
(http://www.calconnect.org) developed a questionnaire about mobile devices currently being
used, their capabilities, and the extent of their support for calendaring applications.

The goal of this questionnaire was to determine how and to what extent Calendaring is being
used on mobile devices, with a view to using those results to aid in the development of
recommendations on how to address any problem areas.

A number of responses were received to the online questionnaire, and a summary and brief
conclusion of these results is presented, along with the raw results themselves.

Respondents to the questionnaire answered based on the capabilities of their device. The results
show an aggregate of these results.

== Questionnaire Background

The questionnaire was answered by 60 respondents, which covered 14 different device
manufacturers and 40 different devices. Most of the devices were high-end mobile devices
released in the last few years. The respondents come from a spread of localities, with 40% of
respondents from America and 38% from the UK.

The questionnaire consists of 53 questions. The bulk of the questions required a "yes", "no" or
"don't know" response. 15 of the questions were text based. Some questions allowed the user
to respond with more than one response (e.g. from a pick list).
The percentage totals for most questions were calculated from the number of answers compared
to the total of all possible answers (typically "yes", "no" or "don't know").

Where the answers are mutually exclusive the total answer percentages add up to 100% (with +/-
1% for rounding errors). For questions where multiple responses are possible the percentages
still show the answer compared to the total of all possible answers, but the total percentage will
not be 100%.

== Summary of Results

=== Section 1 -- General Information

* There is a good spread of respondent's geographic location (though lacking input from
Japanese and South Korean users).
* Good spread of devices -- reasonably representative of (smart) phones for the sample
though generally Palm is much over-represented and Samsung especially is much underrepresented.
* 30% of respondents intend to replace their device soon. This is similar to the yearly
replacement average for US/Europe.
* Balance in usage business / personal use of devices is 50/50
* A quarter of respondents do not travel. Northern hemisphere continents (Europe, Asia, N
America) are all travelled to by a large majority of respondents.
* 18% of respondents travelling to Asia (given only 3% are in Asia) is high
* Of the 28% who do not know if their devices would work out of their primary location, not
all are the 27% who do not travel with their device. 8% of these do travel with their
device
* A large range of primary desktop Calendar applications is used. Slightly surprising there
are not more respondents using Outlook (17%).

=== Section 2 -- General Device Capabilities

* High percentage of "high end" devices in survey, which is supported by a large
percentage of devices having QWERTY keyboards (37%).
* Large amount of perception involved in respondents ranking their devices as low, mid or
high range. The same device is often ranked differently by different respondents
* Large amount of perception involved in respondents describing the screen size. The
same device is often ranked differently by different respondents
* Only 12% of respondents thought their screen "small".
* 32% have run out of space or memory. This is obviously dependent on phone usage.
The results seem to show this is more prevalent on the lower spec phones. However,
this is encountered on the higher end devices too.

=== Section 3 -- Access to Calendar Information

* 95% of respondents normally use their device's Calendar application
* Large number (83%) of devices can run third party apps but 37% don't know if there are
third party calendar apps or not
* 10% use a third party application of their phone
* 43% don't know if they can use a web based calendar. 47% know they can on their
device
* But no respondents normally use web based calendaring on their device
* Respondent / questionnaire confusion over: How to respond to whether they use the
Calendar to View, Edit or View and Edit their data
* 87% of respondents use their device's Calendar application at least once a day
* Almost half of respondents say the experience of using the device's calendar application
is worse than their desktop application. There is some very negative feedback in this
area.
* However 20% said it was better than their desktop application

=== Section 4 -- Calendar Application

* The sophistication of repeat rules seems to be subjective, however some devices don't
support any repeat rules and some devices don't support "second Tuesday in month"
type repeats typically simple (MS Outlook type) functionality seems to be supported
* No-one said alarms can't be created on their entries
* 67% can't invite other people to events - only 18% can. Implies almost all phones don't
support Group Scheduling. Indeed, some of the devices that claim to support this only
support it in a limited way (e.g. Nokia 9500, 9300)
* ToDos widely supported (83%)
* 67% use Data Sync out of the 87% of phones that support Sync
* Numerous different suggestions for Sync improvement
* Most affecting current behaviour -- duplicating entries, slow, poor (or no) interoperability
with desktop apps, poor support for recurrence and no support for syncing multiple
calendars.
* Automatic sync also requested (e.g. over BT)
* Much comment on Data Sync being a limitation for the device:
* 30% saying it was the main thing they wanted to do that they currently couldn't do
* 93% of respondents only have one Calendar on their device
* 58% would like to overlay different calendars on top of the existing one
* Respondents wish to be notified of events with functionality (sounds, alerts, vibrate) that
are currently available on their devices.

=== Section 5 -- Calendar Date and Timezone Support

* Only 42% of respondents say their device knows what the timezone is automatically.
Though some of the replies (compared with the devices in question) are not correct
* Only 7% of respondents say their device allows timezones to be set on events other than
the current timezone
* Despite the fact that only 28% of respondents don't visit other timezones (*) 32% don't
know if their device adjusts the events for the local timezone. 47% of respondents say
their device does do this

=== Section 6 -- Security

* 53% of respondents are concerned about security
* 77% say their calendar content is confidential (business or personal) -- surprisingly high,
but the only other choice was "non-confidential public data"
* However, 55% did not respond on what security features they would like.
** 13% wanted SSL and/or encrypted data
** 12% wanted Password protection at phone or application level
** 7% wanted biometric security

=== Section 7 -- What would you like to do with your mobile calendar?

On aggregate, Free / Busy time viewing is rated as the most important use case (of five)

On aggregate, Adding events downloaded from mobile browser second most important -- this is
more important to respondents than basic Group Scheduling. However, in a straight listing
respondents also ranked this the joint least most important use case

=== Areas of ignorance for the respondents

* The existence of third party calendars for the device (37% don't know)
* If web calendars can be used on the device (43% don't know)
* If timezones can be set on events other than the current timezone (47% don't know)
* How good the documentation/manual is (27% don't know)

=== Selected Answers to Text Questions

==== Q3.9. How would you compare the experience of using the calendar application on this device with using one on a desktop computer?

[quote]
____
Substantially less useful. Due to synchronization problems with my calendar server, the inability
to edit/schedule events is a major issue. Also, the web-based calendar provided by our calendar
server uses frames, which makes browsing from the ##### device very cumbersome.
____

Lots of comments on data entry and screen size

[quote]
____
awkward to view some information, poor summary of information on phone, data input difficult,
no group scheduling
____

==== Q4.10. How would you improve the synchronization support with your desktop calendar?

[quote]
____
iCal supports multiple calendars (eg one for work, one for personal events etc..) - I wish the
phone would support this too
____

[quote]
____
Make it faster and more reliable - syncing sometimes create multiple enteries of the same
entries
____

[quote]
____
I would add support to subscribe to iCal URL's & update at hotsync time
____

[quote]
____
Works great!
____

[quote]
____
Support undo, show user the data being synced - I don't trust sync.
____

==== Q7.1 What would you like to be able to do with your device that you cannot do right now?

[quote]
____
time zones on events. per-event alarm preferences (volume, etc). Share calendars (other
people's). Filter by category. link an event to contacts. want more than 30 chars in Location field
(or link to metadata). show more than just calendar events (todos, for example, or TV listings).
transparent negotiation of meeting times
____

[quote]
____
Sync properly to Oracle Calendar and other calendars. View other people's calendars (not via
web).
____

[quote]
____
push email and cal events. overlay calendars. access event calendars. better scheduling with
corporate cal solution
____

[quote]
____
It would be nice to have multiple calendars to categorise different events, each with there own
sync source. For example work calendar events and personal calendar events, one syncing from
my a work syncML server, the other from my home pc.As mentioned earlier, the ability to apply a
pass code for a calendar with sensitive data (i.e. work related events) would be essential.
