== Why We are here

"Increasingly in business, there is a need to
schedule meetings with people (within or
outside of the company) using different
calendaring systems without multiple
interactions and iterations, which prove to
be time consuming and inefficient. What is
needed is a simple mechanism to see when
a group of people would be available for a
meeting."

== Open Group Vendor Challenges

A vendor challenge is a very practical way to address
the blockages that prevent deployment of a new
technology, and in the context of work within The
Open Group, this means the deployment of a new
standards-based technology.

The whole project is completed within the context of
a very specific problem reported by one or more IT
user organizations. This is important because it
demonstrates to product vendors that there is a
ready market for a solution to the problem, and
encourages their active participation.

== Who We Are

=== The Open Group

The Open Group is a vendor- and technology-neutral
consortium, whose vision of Boundaryless
Information Flow(TM) will enable access to integrated
information within and between enterprises based on
open standards and global interoperability.

In accordance with its vision and mission, The Open
Group works towards enabling access to integrated
information within and between enterprises based on
open standards and global interoperability.

=== CalConnect - The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium

The Consortium is focused on the interoperable
exchange of calendaring and scheduling information
between dissimilar programs, platforms, and
technologies.

The Consortium's mission is to promote general
understanding of and provide mechanisms to allow
interoperable calendaring and scheduling
methodologies, tools and applications to enter the
mainstream of computing.

== Chronology

* 2005/Q1 Brought to the Messaging Forum by The Boeing
Company and Noventum Consulting
* 2006/Q1 Messaging Forum issued Federated Free/Busy
Challenge
* 2006/Q1 Representatives of Open Group brought
FREEBUSY Challenge to CalConnect
* 2006/Q2 proof of concept solution sketched out at
Quarterly Meeting in Washington, D.C. to be promoted as a
joint project between The Open Group and the Calendaring
& Scheduling Consortium
* 2006/Q3 Demo of Proof of Concept Solution at Quarterly
Meeting in Miami
* 2006/Q4 The Challenge final report to be published

== What We Will be Showing You

* Requests to multiple calendar servers in
multiple locations from multiple vendors for
FREEBUSY information for multiple users
* Management of these requests and
aggregation of requested information from
web-based applications
* An interim solution which (adroitly)
sidesteps some issues that will be need to
addressed at some point.

== Why this is Significant

* Major groupware applications already do
this, but not in a heterogeneous calendaring
environment which spans administrative and
geographical domains.
* It is the first step towards solving a problem
which needs to be solved.

== The Requirements

* Uses open standard protocols
* Can be implemented today
* Crosses timezones, cultures, calendaring
systems, corporate and network boundaries

== Relaxed Constraints

* For a constrained list of named attendees
* For a constrained list of times.
* Restricted to organizations that have server
based calendaring systems
* No provision for confirmation that times are
acceptable or for updating calendars
* Can initially exclude provision for recurring
meetings

== Architectural overview

An organizer, aggregator, "avatar" program (or controller)
providing the user interface, having knowledge of attendee
lists and groups, perhaps embed local business logic, and
some useful level of functionality aggregating and
displaying results from the FREEBUSY queries.

A CalDAV-compliant free/busy interface (CC-FBI) layer (or
"proxy" which would field CalDAV free/busy queries from,
and return results to, the organizer program. This interface
would only have to support enough CalDAV to support
free/busy queries.

A number of "connector" servers or services, at the edge of
the network, to interface to systems which do not support
CalDAV.

== How we did it

* Coordinated in the CalConnect FREEBUSY
technical committee
* Modified code from the open source
Bedework calendar
* "Connector" code contributed by IBM,
Boeing, and TimeBridge
* Cooperative and collegial development and
testing among calendar developers

== The Secret of Our Success - CalDAV

CalDAV is designed for implementation by any
collaborative software, client or server that needs to
maintain, access, or share collections of events. It is being
developed as an open standard to foster interoperability.

CalDAV builds upon extant standards (RFC 2445, WebDAV)
while anticipating and allowing changes in the future such
as XML representations of calendaring formats.

Mozilla, Oracle, Open Software Applications Foundation,
Novell, Bedework have publicly announced plans to support
CalDAV.

CalDAV provides enterprises the promise of
comprehensive, interoperable, global calendaring solution.

== What We Learned

* Enlightened self interest and open standards are a
powerful combination
* Even calendar developers who claim they use "open
calendar standards" may have non-conforming
implementations.
* Open APIs are good. Widely adopted open standards
are better.
* Open standards need to be unambiguous ensure
implementations will interpret those standards in
interoperable way.

== What remains to be done?

* Adroitly solve the problems we are presently
adroitly sidestepping:
** Discovery
** Authentication and access control
** Enfranchising additional calendaring systems
* Migrate this solution to use the richer
functionality of the still developing "Scheduling
Extensions to CalDAV" specifications.
* Encourage wider participation among calendar
developers and calendar users
