== Report

The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018

In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were
representatives from

* Spherical Cow Group
* FastMail
* Open-Xchange
* Ribose
* Jorte

Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which
required discussion and implementation.

Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a
presentation and demonstration in the conference.

We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on.
As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The
description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd
attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of
recurrences.

The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange
members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This
specification allows DAV clients to `POST` subscription requests to the server which
then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be
added: a "refresh now" option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors
to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.

We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in
preparation for presentations later in the week.

Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for
face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.
