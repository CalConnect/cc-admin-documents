Re: June 1-3, 2005 Interop Test Results

The following report details the results from the interop testing event held at
Duke University in Durham on June 1-3, 2005. The report includes text as
well as a spreadsheet with actual results of scenario testing.

The attached version includes the public, abridged text and is meant for

== Report

The following organizations and personnel participated in a two-day interoperability testing
event held on June 1-3, 2005 at Duke University.

[%unnumbered]
|===
| Organization | Representative
| Isamet | Cyrus Daboo
| Mozilla | Dan Mosedale
| Rodney Price | Novell{blank}footnote:[Novell was auditing the testing event -- their product was not tested.]
| Simon Vaillancourt | Oracle
| Mike Douglass | Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)
|===

Versions tested are as follows:

Isamet:

* Mulberry v4.0 - client (publicly released)
* Mulberry J2ME v0.1 - client (not released)
* ISAMET CalDAV server v0.2 - server (not released)

Mozilla:

* Mozilla Lightening Client -- no version number available (yet)

Oracle:

* CalConnectCalDAVTest script - Version 1.0
* OracleCalDAV server - June-2005 version!

RPI:

* UWCalendar - Version RPI-2.3.1

=== Interop Discussion Items

At the beginning of the interoperability event, we held a general discussion with each of the
participants. They in turn discussed what would be tested, and the current status of their
implementations. We also agreed upon userids, server names and IP addresses to access
the servers.

VendorA, B and C provided URL's for connection to their servers. Two were situated locally
on the intranet and one was on a public IP address. These three servers were then used
during testing by the two clients.

VendorA tested two clients and one server. They support level 5 of Caldav. Their desktop
client has been publicly released. Their server had a few minor changes since the last
interop testing. In addition, they are working on a FreeBusy report. Multi Get has been
implemented in their client. Their mobile client had no changes since the last interop
testing event.

VendorC tested their client; however, their server had an issue arise so it was not tested
during the interop. There are no version numbers yet assigned. They support version 5 of
the Caldav draft.

VendorB tested both a client and a server implementation. They also support version 5 of
the Caldav draft. They are working on the Keep Alive connection. Simon noted that we
need to ensure that applications are also WEBDAV and HTTP compliant since much of the
CALDAV draft rides upon those specifications. For the purpose of this event, we are
assuming applications support the current levels of both WEBDAV and HTTP.

VendorD has a server and runs on a skeletal Webdav server. They do not support ACLs or
recurrences. Their Put/Get works and they support reports. They support level 5 of the
Caldav draft as well.

A set of test scenarios had been provided by Bernard Desruisseaux from Oracle. These
scenarios focused on a specific set of events for testing. The events tested were as follows:

Calendar Events

* Creation
* Modification
* Deletion
* Query

Access Control

* Creation
* Modification
* Deletion

Several tables at the end of this report breakdown each test scenario. There is a table for
each client that show how each of the three servers responded to their calendar
submissions. There is also a table that show what each server supports.

=== Summary

Overall, the specific items tested went well. Not all of the specification was tested -- what
was tested did not point out any specific issues with the draft.

Items of note are:

* Access Control Lists are not yet supported by any of the servers or clients.
* Clients and servers both had some issues with respect to their implementation of the draft
components. Several of those items were fixed during the testing. All clients still have
some components that are not yet working and are still under development.
* Two servers support the majority of the items selected for testing during this event. The
third server supports less but is well on its way towards being a robust Caldav server.
* With regards to RFC2445, the iCalendar specification, there appears to be an issue with
recurring rules with DTSTART in UTC. While it is not valid in RFC2445, several of the
vendors support DTSTART in UTC. Therefore, this issue needs to be addressed -- either the
RFC2445 must be changed or the vendors need to change their applications to support the
current RFC2445. This is an issue that will be turned over to the Calsify technical group as
it will be pertinent to the simplification work going on for RFC2445.
* Going forward, we need to get additional vendors into the testing group. It would be good
to see if we can find additional mobile vendors for testing as well. The consortium will be
looking into ways of expanding the number of vendors that participate during
interoperability events. The more we test, the more we ensure a good specification.
* In order to move the draft to proposed standard level within the IETF (after it becomes an
RFC), we will need to test all the MUSTS/SHOULDS/MUST NOTS/SHOULD NOTS in the draft
in order to be considered interoperable. Pat Egen, the interop manager, volunteered to put
together a matrix of these components and will post this on the public Calconnect server.

Finally, the following are comments by two of the participants stating how they felt the
interop went overall.

NOTE: Recurrence between VENDORC and VENDORB is currently non-functional.

NOTE: VENDORC's overriding/exceptions is not working yet.

NOTE: Current VENDORC Lightening VI doesn't support creation other than via 
drag-to-create and modify
to change things like title. That will change soon. The backend code supports 1.1-1.3 but not yet 1.4.

NOTE: VENDORC used their Lightening product for testing.
