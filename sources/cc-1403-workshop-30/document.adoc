== Introduction

CalConnect sponsored an open half-day workshop on the Veterans Administration Scheduling System
Challenge on Wednesday afternoon 21 May 2014 as part of CalConnect XXX, hosted by AOL in Dulles,
Virginia. Registered attendance for the event was 47, of which 26 came for the workshop; a few also
registered for part of the Conference taking place on Thursday and Friday. The preliminary agenda and
notes about the panelists may be found at VA Scheduling System Workshop.

== Why we convened this workshop

In late 2012, The U.S. Veterans Administration announced a "prize contest" to "...encourage creation of
systems that help Veterans make appointments to receive outpatient and ambulatory care from the
Veterans Health Administration" and ultimately "...to replace the current Medical Scheduling Package
(MSP) with a scheduling product which is a standards-based, modular, extensible and scalable...".
Recently, when the winning proposals were announced, we decided to use the VA Scheduling Contest as
a jump point to explore the importance of open calendaring and scheduling standards with respect to
Healthcare IT.

CalConnect's goal for the workshop, and especially the Panel Discussion, was to engage our
membership with the panelists and other attendees in a discussion of Health Care scheduling needs and
requirement in the context of calendaring and scheduling standards and interoperability. We hoped to
learn at a functional level what Health Care has today in Calendaring and Scheduling, what it needs in the
Calendaring and Scheduling standards and specifications that it does not have today, and what its needs
will be tomorrow.

In turn, from the discussion we hoped would come better understanding, an initial insight as to what areas
of the calendaring and scheduling work we are undertaking were relevant to Health Care, and how they
may need to be changed or extended to better address the needs of the Health Care community.

== Mailing List for Workshop Attendees

Following the Panel Discussion, CalConnect offered to arrange a limited-life mailing list for everyone who
attended the workshop to be able to interact. The e-mails of everyone registered for the workshop have
been entered into the list; anyone who is not interested in being on the list may remove themselves or
send Dave Thewlis a request to be removed. We anticipate the mailing list will be shut down by the end of
the summer unless there is some need to keep it available.

== Conclusions and Thanks

Although it is too early to identify specific areas for collaboration and work, it is clear that CalConnect's
work in scheduling, in particular the applicability of some of the protocols we are developing such as
`VPOLL` and `VAVAILABILITY` to such needs as machine-to-machine scheduling, are extremely pertinent,
and as our understanding increases we look forward to making these tools more usable and available to
the Health Care community. Of course, involvement by interested members of the Health Care community
in this work will be essential both for understanding and resources and we invite members of that Health
Care community to get involved with us.

CalConnect thanks all of the participants in the workshop and everyone who worked to make it a success.
