.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of

== Introduction

CalConnect XL took place September 27-29, 2017, hosted by Open-Xchange in
Cologne, Germany. The CalConnect Test Event (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
morning) and Conference (Wednesday afternoon, Thursday and Friday) were held at
Komed House, a conference facility in the Cologne Media Park.

The CalConnect Conference was attended by 20 people from 12 members plus a
guest from GFI. The Test Event/Developers Forum had 10 participants from 7
members and was largely devoted to the forum and CalDAV Tester rather than specific
testing.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing
work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The
Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect
XL Conference Schedule.

== Status of documents since last conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications to become
internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to publication as
RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than directly published by CalConnect itself.

Specifications in progress and not yet published are generally resident on GitHub either
in our public or private areas.

=== CalConnect Drafts to be Published as Informational RFCs

* CalDAV Managed Attachments (TC CALENDAR)

=== CalConnect Drafts in CALEXT Working Group Last Call at IETF

* Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar (TC CALENDAR)

=== CalConnect Drafts in Progressing at CALEXT Working Group at IETF

* Improved Support for iCalendar Relationships (TC CALENDAR

=== New and Updated CalConnect Drafts at the IETF

* Push Discovery and Notification Dispatch Protocol (TC CALENDAR)
* Calendar Subscription Upgrades
* JSCalendar: A JSON representation of calendar data

== General status and announcements

Ronald Tse of Ribose was elected the sixth CalConnect Director, and was appointed
Director, External Relationships.

CalConnect has established a formal Category A Liaison with ISO/TC 211 and is
exploring a similar liaison with ISO/TC 154. We are also exploring a joint liaison with
M3AAWG.

== Status of technical committee and related work; plans for future work

=== TC API

Work on JSCalendar is progressing, accommodating contacts and tasks as well as
events.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Pending; Draft update in progress

=== TC CALENDAR

Work continues on categorization and event types, consistent handling of per-user
data in events, support for series in iCalendar (as an alternative to recurrences), alarms
and transparency in JSCalendar, generic notification systems for alarms, calendar
subscription upgrades, extensions for improved grouping of properties, and a
CalConnect version of ical4j.

=== TC DEVGUIDE

Service has been migrated of open shift to the Google App engine. We are looking for
help with the wikipedia article on CalConnect and related articles. Discussion of
additional areas to be added to the Developers Guide including CalDAV Tester.

=== TC IOPTEST

See separate report on Test Event at CalConnect XL. TC IOPTEST calls have been
integrated into the Event Planning calls and no separate IOPTEST calls were held since
the previous event in June.

=== TC PUSH

Draft has been submitted to the IETF; we are exploring which working group should
handle it. Looking for more implementations.

=== TC SHARING

Calendar Subscription Upgrades decided on a new status (not cancelled) and adding
time range query. Working on how to advertise which timezone server is used.

=== TC TESTER

Brief report on the status of the work.

=== TC VCARD

Several presentations on status in TC VCARD and progress at ISO/TC 211. TC VCARD
is working on the New Work Item Proposal on a machine-readable address profile data
format for TC 211 and expects to submit it soon, perhaps by the next TC 211 Plenary.

=== BOF sessions

Birds of a Feather sessions were held on security and on streaming for iCalendar data.

Work will continue on a security model starting from VCARD security, via mailing list
and slack. Proposed an initial call for an Ad Hoc on Streaming.

== Plenary meeting

Oath (combined AOL and Yahoo) will host the Winter 2018 CalConnect XLI in
Sunnyvale, California.

Specific dates were set for CalConnect XLI and CalConnect XLIII (see below).

* CalConnect XLII - June 4-8, 2018 - Jorte, Tokyo, Japan
* CalConnect XLIII - September 24028, 2018 - 1&1, Karlsruhe, Germany

The general format of the CalConnect Week is:
