== Introduction

This document was created by the USECASE Technical Committee of the Calendaring and Scheduling
Consortium. The document lists use cases that utilize resources within the calendaring and scheduling
application domain. We realize that some of the use cases presented may include workflow or ideas beyond
what is offered by current calendaring and scheduling applications.

== Methodology

The USECASE Technical Committee regularly met in conference call to discuss the use of resources in the
calendaring and scheduling domain. When we decided to draft resource use cases we each chose a perspective
from which to view the use of resources. One of us chose the role of a social worker in the medical profess
while another chose the role of social worker in the justice/social services field while another chose the
perspective of a business man working on a construction project. Other perspectives were also chosen. The
resulting use cases were then organized by number and a category supplied for each use case.

The categories selected for the use case organization reflect a grouping of resources into sets differentiated by
type. Each of these categories touches on an area discussed by the Technical Committee over the course of our
deliberations about resources in calendaring.

. Person -- People can properly be thought of as resources, especially given the knowledge and skills they
have which may be unique to them or to the position they hold (e.g., project manager for a particular
project).
. Location -- Rooms and places are a particularly important resource category and are presently found in
nearly every major calendaring and scheduling product.
. Equipment -- Things or objects which can be scheduled (e.g., projectors, laptops, vans).
. Material -- Things necessary for a meeting that must be reserved or checked out (e.g., documents,
personnel files, records).
. Role -- The term 'role' is used to cover attributes common to a collective from among the resource
categories which can be used to schedule one or more from among the collective (e.g., fork lifts with a
particular lifting capacity, waitresses, waiters, front desk clerks).
. Other -- Schedulable 'things' not covered by the other five categories (e.g., a staff in/out calendar).

The medical social worker looks for a hospice in the patient's home region (he is from a different area than the hospital). Issues to consider in selecting a hospice are availability, philosophy (religion-based?) if any, cost, contract or other payment agreement with patient's health insurance company, and ability to provide care needed with patient's particular condition. | person, location | 3
| 41. A case manager for the bone marrow transplant unit needs to arrange a hospital-to-hospital transfer for an incoming patient within a particular time frame. Medical transportation via ambulance is needed. Ambulance service is available from several private companies. Issues to consider in selecting an ambulance are availability, whether the ambulance company services the two hospitals, which ambulance companies have a contract with the patient's health insurance company, and what particular medical care will be needed by the patient during the transfer. | person, location | 3
| 42. A patient in the bone marrow transplant unit is doing well after treatment and is ready to released to his home. For some period of time, he will need to have home care visits from a qualified medical professional.

As a responsible host, she also knows she'll need a car and driver to get W.C. home; the driver must be capable of wrangling a sizable adult male. | person, location, equipment | 4
| 45. Andrew needs to schedule a meeting for 14 people from disparate organizations, with an on-projector presentation. The 'big' room is booked, but the 'little' room is available. The big room has an in-ceiling projector, but the little room requires bringing in a portable unit. Andrew knows from experience that the little room will work, with an alternate chair layout and if folks get cozy. He also knows of an alternate room, in another building and owned by an external organization, which can easily accommodate the crowd and provide a projector; the third room has the advantage of better signage and more available/convenient parking. Andrew needs to determine if the "big" room is actually being used? Can I bump them to a different location? Is the portable projector available? Is the external room available? | person, location, equipment | 4
