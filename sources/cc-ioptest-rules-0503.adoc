== Test Scenarios

[%unnumbered,cols=2]
|===
h| 1. h| Event creation.
| 1.1. | Create new single-instance meeting titled "Meeting 1.1" with the location "Durham".
| 1.2. | Create new meeting titled "Meeting 1.2" recurring every Monday from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM for 4 weeks.
| 1.3. | Create new single-instance meeting titled "Meeting 1.3" with 2 other attendees.
| 1.4. | Create new single-instance meeting titled "Meeting 1.4" with an alarm set to trigger 15 minutes prior to the schedule time of the meeting.
h| 2. h| Event modification
| 2.1. | Modify the title of meeting "Meeting 1.1" to "Meeting 1.1bis".
| 2.2. | Modify the location of the meeting "Meeting 1.1bis" to "Seattle bis".
| 2.3. | Reschedule meeting "Meeting 1.1bis" to the next day.
| 2.4. | Add an attendee to "Meeting 1.1bis".
| 2.5. | Add an alarm to "Meeting 1.1bis".
| 2.6. | Modify the title of the 1st instance of the recurring meeting created in 1.2.
| 2.7. | Modify the participation status of 1st instance to DECLINED.
| 2.8. | Cancel the 4th instance of the recurring meeting created in 1.2.
| 2.9. | One client changes "Meeting 1.1bis" to a different time, second client 'refreshes' its display to see the modification.
h| 3. h| Event retrieval
| 3.1. | calendar-query REPORT
| 3.1.1. | No filtering (match everything)
| 3.1.1.1. | Query all components and return all data. (tests <calendar-query> and <filter>)
| 3.1.1.2. | Query all components and return ETag WebDAV property and all data. (tests <calendarquery>+<DAV:prop> and <filter>)
| 3.1.1.3. | Query all components and return just entire VEVENT components. (tests <calendarquery>, <filter>+<comp-filter>)
| 3.1.1.4. | Query all components and return VEVENT components with only DTSTART, DTEND/DURATION, SUMMARY, UID, SEQUENCE, RRULE, RDATE, EXRULE, EXDATE, RECURRENCE-ID. (tests <calendar-query> , <filter>+<comp-filter>, <calendar-data>+<comp>+<prop>)
| 3.1.2. | time-range filtering
| 3.1.2.1. | Query all components within a one day time-range and return all data. Make sure that there is a recurring event that starts prior to the chosen time-range but has one non-overridden instance within the time-range. (tests <calendar-query> , <filter>+<time-range>)
| 3.1.2.2. | Query all components within a one week time-range and return just entire VEVENT components. Make sure that there is a recurring event that starts prior to the chosen time-range but has one overridden instance within the time-range. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<time-range>)
| 3.1.3. | component based filtering
| 3.1.3.1. | Query all components that contain an embedded VALARM component. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<comp-filter>)
| 3.1.3.2. | Query all components that contain an embedded VALARM component whose trigger falls within a specific time-range. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<comp-filter>+<prop-filter>+<time-range>)
| 3.1.4. | property based filtering
| 3.1.4.1. | Query all components that contain any ORGANIZER property. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<prop-filter>+<is-defined>)
| 3.1.4.2. | Query all components that contain an ORGANIZER property with a specific CUA text value case-insensitively. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<prop-filter>+<text-match>+<caseless>)
| 3.1.4.3. | Query all components that contain an ORGANIZER property with a specific CUA text value case-sensitively. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<prop-filter>+<textmatch>+<caseless>)
| 3.1.5. | parameter based filtering
| 3.1.5.1. | Query all components that contain a DTSTART property with a TZID parameter. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<prop-filter>+<text-match>+<param-filter>+<is-defined>)
| 3.1.5.2. | Query all components that contain an ATTENDEE property with PARTSTAT=NEEDSACTION parameter. (tests <calendar-query>, <filter>+<prop-filter>+<text-match>+<param-filter>+<text-match>)
| 3.2. | calendar-multiget REPORT
| 3.2.1. | Query a specific href and return all data. (tests <calendar-multiget>)
| 3.2.2. | Query multiple hrefs (some of which do not exist) and return all data. (tests <calendar-multiget>)
| 3.2.3. | Query a specific href and return ETag WebDAV property and all data. (tests <calendar-multiget>+<DAV:prop>)
| 3.2.4. | Query multiple hrefs (some of which do not exist) and return ETag WebDAV property and all data. (tests <calendar-multiget>+<DAV:prop>)
| 3.2.5. | Query a specific href and return VEVENT components with only DTSTART, DTEND/DURATION, SUMMARY, UID, SEQUENCE, RRULE, RDATE, EXRULE, EXDATE, RECURRENCE-ID. (tests <calendar-query>, <calendar-data>+<comp>+<prop>)
| 3.2.6. | Query multiple hrefs (some of which do not exist) and return VEVENT components with only DTSTART, DTEND/DURATION, SUMMARY, UID, SEQUENCE, RRULE, RDATE, EXRULE, EXDATE, RECURRENCE-ID. (tests <calendar-query >, <calendar-data>+<comp>+<prop>)
h| 4. h| Event deletion
| 4.1. | Delete a single non-recurring meeting.
| 4.2. | Delete a single recurring meeting with no overridden instances.
| 4.3. | Delete a single recurring meeting with overridden instances.
