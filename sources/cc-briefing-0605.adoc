== What is CalConnect?

=== What is the Consortium

* “Provide a general understanding of,
promote, and provide mechanisms so that
Calendaring and Scheduling methodologies,
tools and applications can enter the
mainstream of computing”
* A Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Association
incorporated in the State of California
* Granted 501(&#x200c;c)6 tax-exempt status by the
Federal Government

=== Why does it exist

* Progress of Calendaring and Scheduling
standards seemed to be stalled
** Existing specifications insufficient and incomplete
** Existing products do not interoperate well
** Products continuing to diverge
* Need for a separate, focused environment to
take the next steps in Calendaring
** Establish value of C&S standards in the marketplace
** Help bring applications into mainstream use
* Help standards progress
** Promote use of current and new standards to vendor,
corporate and educational communities
** Influence how standards evolve
** Influence vendors to implement the standards
** CalConnect is not itself a standards body

=== Goals of the Consortium

* Promote Calendaring & Scheduling
* Interoperability testing and Certification
* Promote design & implementation of
* Calendaring & Scheduling Standards and
implementations
* Promote collaboration among members
* Support common goals of members
* Develop a shared vision for the Calendaring
& Scheduling community

=== Technical Committees

== Calsify

=== TC Calsify versus Calsify

TC started to support Calsify effort in IETF to develop
revisions of iCalendar and related specifications and
progress to standards. Function taken over by TCChairs
now that Calsify working group established
within IETF.

Anyone can participate in effort through the IETF.

* General Discussion: ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org
* To Subscribe: http://lists.osafoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-calsify
* Archive: http://lists.osafoundation.org/pipermail/ietf-calsify/

Current focus is on clarification (not simplification)
and they could use help.

=== RFC 2445bis

* http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-calsifyrfc2445bis-00.txt
* Changes done so far mostly clerical to make
document more readable
* http://ietf.webdav.org/calsify/meetings/IETF65_CALSIFY.ppt
* http://www.calconnect.org/publications/icalendarrecurrenceproblemsandrecommendationsv1.0.pdf
* Are there issues related to sync that should be
considered?
** What needs to get done for implementers to jump from
vCal?

=== CalConnect Interoperability Testing Events (CITE)

CalConnect hosted testing sessions will help
push new drafts to full standard.

OMA TestFest results could potentially help
with this as well (if more client vendors
switched from vCal to iCAL!!!!)

== "Cardsify"?

=== TC Cardsify

As with TC Calsify such a TC could support a
Cardsify effort in IETF to develop revisions
of vCARD if it existed.

Preliminary BOF Call hosted by CalConnect
held.
* Should this be considered within the scope of
CalConnect?
* Are there sufficient resources to make such a TC
viable (CalConnect is still a fairly small
organization)?
* Any issues from IMC?

=== RFC2426bis?

* Should effort be made?
** vCard is sort of calendar, sort of email, sort of
directory. It ends up falling through the crack and
no one takes real ownership. Effort seems well
overdue.
* Should CalConnect undertake Effort?
** New membership willing to actively work as part
of such a TC would need to be identified.
* OMA DS could equally shepherd such an
effort
* Any interested persons can submit draft of
new vCard to IETF.

== Time zone registry and service

=== TC Timezone

* Technical Committee investigating the
problems with the usage of time zones.
* Findings published by CalConnect:
** iCalendar time zone problems and
recommendations
http://www.calconnect.org/publications/icalendartimezoneproblemsandrecommendationsv1.0.pdf
* Time zone registry and service
recommendations.
** To be published in April

=== Standardized Time Zones

Why are standardized time zones needed?

* For improved interoperability: Calendar
applications need to have a reliable list of
time zones and their associated rules in
order to avoid the following common
problems:
** Consuming unknown time zones.
** Consuming known time zones with identical TZIDs
but different rule.
* Calendar applications need to have means
of updating time zones and all affected data
(i.e. previously created recurring meetings.)
in an efficient and correct manner.
* Having standardized time zones would open
the door to using time zones by reference
rather than by value (Sending only the time
zone id rather than the whole time zone
with its rules). This could potentially help
applications where bandwidth usage is
important such as mobile devices.
* Any other non-iCalendar products having to
deal with time zones could also benefit from
it (Operating systems, java...).

=== Time zone registry

What do we want (or not) in a time zone registry?

* TZID and Rules should both be in a registry.
* Re-use what’s already there (TZ Database).
* Versioning is not necessary, since time zone
changes occur in the future; existing events
shouldn’t be affected by a new time zone. A
timestamp on each time zone should be
sufficient to cover most use cases.
* Final implementation should be done using a
standardized process, the new time zone
registry should be coordinated by IANA

Who should publish?

=== Time zone service

What do we want (or not) in a time zone service?

* The time zones should be in a VTIMEZONE
format as defined in RFC 2445.
* The time zone service should be built on top
of a known platform such as: HTTP, CalDAV,
DNS, or ITIP.
* The time zone service should be able to return
a time zone based on a supplied TZID and/or
VTIMEZONE object (Closest match).

Who should host such services?

== The future of mobile calendaring

=== TC MOBILE

Our goals are:

* to identify the issues associated with mobile
calendaring & scheduling
* to propose a vision of what mobile calendaring
should be
* to propose recommendations on how to address
any problem areas
** For example, extensions or additions to existing standards
or profiles for mobile devices
** The recommendations are aimed at vendors and standards
developers

We are keen to promote adoption of open
calendaring standards for mobile devices
(e.g. iCalendar, OMA DS, and CalDAV).

=== TC MOBILE Questionnaire

We have created a questionnaire on mobile
device capabilities.
The aim is to better understand what feature sets
are currently supported, and what is desired by
users.

We will analyse the questionnaire results
and identify the gap between user needs
and current capabilities.

The questionnaire is available at http://www.calconnect.org/mobileQs_v2.html.

Results to be presented at Roundtable VI.

=== Vision for mobile calendaring

We are creating a ‘Vision for interoperable
calendaring on mobile devices’

* This document will describe how use cases
desired by users can be implemented using open
standards and identify new problems to be solved
* We are gathering user requirements through a
questionnaire and by organising discussions with
specific user groups
* We would like more participants from
organisations and vendors in the mobile industry

=== How can you participate?

OMA DS members can participate by:

* completing our questionnaire on Mobile device
capabilities;
* attending the TC Mobile session at the CalConnect
May Round Table meeting. We would like for this
session to be a half day mobile calendaring
workshop.

== What’s Next?

=== Looking for Feedback

* Does OMA DS have any special
requirements for the Calsify Effort?
* Would OMA DS be supportive of a time zone
registry and service?
* Can OMA DS member companies commit to
helping along a Cardsify effort?
* Do OMA DS member companies have
thoughts on what they foresee as the future
of mobile calendaring?

=== Roundtable VI

* Roundtable VI -- 23-25 May 2006
* Cambridge, MA
* Invitation to OMA DS to present feedback to
Consortium
* Planning session for half day mobile
calendaring workshop.
