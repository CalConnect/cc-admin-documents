== General Status and Items from Conference XLIV

=== TC-API

Work on JSCalendar and related JSxxx documents is progressing very well. Work on
contact-related stuff in TC 211 and vCard has to be kept aligned and moving forward,,
probably via JSContacts. See references under other TCs to JMAP and JSCalendar/
Contacts/etc.

=== TC-AUTODISCOVERY

Register MIME-type so a config could be email/etc and opening the attachment
triggers the client(s) to be configured. Others are very interested in the work.

=== TC-CALENDAR

Scheduling on Shared Calendars: We believe that Apple use Calendar User Proxy
(calendar-proxy capability) for handling secretary mode. Team sharing mode simply
acts on behalf of the principal associated with that instance of the calendar

JMAP Calendars: Several edits to be made based on discussions.

`VPOLL`: Update draft using `PARTICIPANT` component rather than `VVOTER` component.
Split `BASIC` mode specific bits into their own section describing `BASIC` mode. Publish
this draft ASAP unless we think we can add new poll mode(s) quickly.

Second poll mode would be `SIGNUP` mode where a bunch of tasks need to be
handled and voters choose 1 or more that they are willing to complete (e.g. preparing
for and/or bringing items for a dinner party)

Third poll mode would be the case of asking dentist office (or hairdresser or automotive
garage) for available time slots for a procedure

Server-side subscriptions: Compare/contrast current draft with Apple telemetry.

`VALARM` Extensions: Add `RELATED-TO` back in. Add text on security considerations
of proximity alarms.

=== TC-DATETIME

Working on developing a relative date/time notation based on ISO grammar.
Also would like to come up with a way to tag date/time values with calendar system,
time system, and time zone id. Working on human representation. Decide to create
proposals for ISO/TC 154 plenary.

=== TC-LOCALIZATION

Writing conversion system codes. Moving forward, will be the third pillar of the trio of
ISO 639 (language codes), ISO 15924 (script codes) and ISO 24229 (writing conversion
system codes). Romanization of Cantonese will be re-balloted for participation. Name
model proceeding in ISO/TC 37 pending ballot. Will accelerate solicitation/completion
of cultural profiles

=== TC-PUSH

Ask Chair to do the split of the draft and update with RFC 8030 references where
needed. Interest in writing a server implementations, but is there any realistic chance of
more client support? Need someone to review authentication/security. Align with
Open-Xchange work on IMAP WebPush.

=== TC-USECASE

Define 'client' early in charter. Deal with interoperability issues - more work on caldav
tester. Links to client libraries..

There was some discussion on incentives (reduced participant fee) for Open Source
developers at ZÃ¼rich conference. Also an interesting point regarding to try draw
audience from the scientific community (e.g., inviting for scientific/industry paper
submissions related to CalConnect topics)
Decided to rename TC to TC-CLIENT

=== TC-VCARD

JSContacts: Discussion about how best to do localizations. 2 different approaches.
This will probably be hashed out in IETF JMAP WG once accepted

No support for non-Westernized addresses yet. Specification of Groups needs more
work

Document models: Lightweight document model for Markdown, AsciiDoc, RTF as
interchangeable rich text'

Location vCard: Metadata for a location. vCard already contains "kind: location", and
defined `STRUCTURED-LOCATION` in resource vCard work.

TC VCARD agreed to take over the joint work of OGC, ECCMA, W3C and ISO's work
on POI (point of interest) and develop with them as partners

Enumerate use cases for industries: maps, navigation, travel, theme parks

Will define method of place identification, including ISO 19155 (place identifier),
ECCMA/OGC NLI (ECCMA 1 standard)

Find additional collaborators: IATA, UN (for LOCODE).

Standardized profile and digital addresses proceeding.

== Joint Working Group Calls

The joint working group calls with IETF CALEXT and ISO/TC 154/WG 5 went very well.

== Plenary Meeting

CalConnect will hold two rather than three events in 2020: a spring event in April and
an autumn event in late September/early October.

Interest in being involved in creating the scheduling agenda for future events; we plan
to distribute the calls to meeting for Event Planning to the general calconnect-l mailing
list and post event reports etc. on that list as well to try and get additional and early
involvement, beginning with Event Planning calls in November for CalConnect XLVII.

== Confirmed Future Events

* Cronofy will host CalConnect XLVII on April 20-24, 2020 in Nottingham, United
Kingdom.
* CalConnect XLVIII will be in Autumn 2020, host, location and exact dates TBD.
