.Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.

CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.

In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different types of
ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the
editorial rules of the CalConnect Directives.

== Introduction

CalConnect XLIII took place September 24-27, 2018, hosted by 1&1 in Karlsruhe, Germany. The
conference was held on 1&1's premises. The conference was attended by a total of 20 people from 10
member organizations.

This conference was a one-time experiment with a new conference format, technical and conference
tracks alternating each day, and a single fee rather than the previous separate fees for the test
event and conference. It was also a 4-day event, Monday through Thursday, rather than the 5 days
that the previous format required to attend both the test event and the conference. The new format
was based on recommendations from a working group set up by the CalConnect Board at the beginning
of the year, to examine the current formats and make recommendations for future changes.

The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and
finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session prior to lunch on Thursday. Thursday afternoon was
open time for working sessions. The schedule was rearranged during the week based on input from
participants. The final Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at
https://www.calconnect.org/events/calconnect-xliii-september-2018#conference-schedule[CalConnect XLIII Conference Schedule].

== Status of Documents Since Last Conference

Much of the ongoing work in CalConnect is focused on specifications and standards, many of which
will become internet draft submissions to the IETF and ultimately be progressed to publication as
RFCs (Proposed Standards), rather than directly published by CalConnect itself. CalConnect will
also co-publish standards with other standards organizations, or self-publish as needed.

Specifications in progress and not yet published are generally resident on GitHub either in our
public or private areas.

=== CalConnect Drafts to be Published as Informational RFCs

* CalDAV Managed Attachments (TC CALENDAR)

=== CalConnect Drafts in CALEXT Working Group Last Call at IETF

* Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar (TC CALENDAR)
* Improved Support for iCalendar Relationships (TC CALENDAR

=== CalConnect Drafts in Last Call at CALEXT Working Group at IETF

* JSCalendar: A JSON representation of Calendar data

=== CalConnect Drafts in Last Call at IESG

* The Time Zone Information Format (TZif)

=== CalConnect Drafts in Progress at TZDIST-BIS Working Group at IETF

* The Time Zone Data Distribution Service (TZDIST) Geolocate Extension

== Calconnect Liaisons

CalConnect has formal reciprocal membership liaisons with M3AAWG and OASIS and a strong working
relationship with the IETF.

CalConnect has established formal Category A Liaisons with the following ISO Committees:

* ISO PC 317
* ISO TC 154
* ISO TC 211
* ISO TC 46
* ISO JTC 1 SC 27
* ISO TC 37

== General Status and Items

An Adhoc Committee on the EU Time proposal to discontinue Summer Time has been created to submit
an Advisory Report to the EU. We anticipate holding a workshop on this subject at CalConnect XLIV
in February 2019.

TC DATETIME has been created to further CalConnect work on date and time formats and related
issues, and to provide a "home" for our liaison with ISO TC 211 and ISO TC 154 and the drafts on
ISO 8601-1 and 8601-2 on date and time formats and recurrences. Also timezone data model and how
to announce TZ changes (management standard?)

TC LOCALIZATION has been created to further CalConnect work on localization of calendaring and
schedule event information and related work such as address formats,
and to provide a home for our liaison with ISO TC 37 in the area of naming and addressing.

CalConnect is planning to resume its practice of self-publishing standards, which hasn't been done
for some time as much of its work has focused on extensions to existing IETF specifications (many
of which were also developed by CalConnect). To further this work, new CalConnect Standards
Directives have been written to bring our document requirement and progression and publishing
policies and procedures in line with ISO and other international standards organizations. The
Plenary meeting approved a recommendation to the CalConnect Board of Directors to adopt the draft
directives.

Feedback was obtained on the new conference format being tried at this event (as a one-time trial)
as noted above. In general the format is well thought of, several adjustments were made to the
schedule as the week progressed.

Formal testing was not done as part of the program at this event, although individuals are welcome
to test as desired during the course of the meeting.

== Future Work

=== TC API

JSCalendar is in working group last call at the IETF. Work continues with JSContacts and JSTasks.

=== TC AUTODISCOVERY

Interest in reactivating the group and moving forward with open issues and new items brought up in
discussion. ICalConnect can publish this draft as a CalConnect Standard. Possibly have a call to
follow up on discussion.

=== TC CALENDAR

* Discussion about DTSTART being part first instance of a recurrence but not part of the RRULE,
file erratum on the RFC

* Interest in party-crashing draft, will encourage Google to write the drat and perhaps implement
and test the feedback from clients

* Presentations on both JSCalendar and JMAP.

* Discussion on what to do about e-Tag, create a best practice document.

* Discussion on public calendars and how to move forward, perhaps another paper.

* Server side Subscription.

=== TC CALSPAM

Best current practices document is nearly ready for public review. Discussion of the abuse audit
draft.

=== TC DEVGUIDE

* Continue Move page content from Drupal to Devguide where appropriate

* Looking into GitHub pages (layout first, CNAME second)

* Relocated the DevGuide to a Google offering in support of future requirements

=== TC PUSH

Prof-of-concept implementation exists; definite interest from FastMail. Still looking for a home
for the draft; if necessary CalConnect can publish it. Possibly have a call to follow up on
discussion. Need to develop error conditions.

=== TC SHARING

Annotation, subscription, server side subscription

=== TC STREAMING

Plan finalize the specification without a specific protocol as it should be a generalized approach.

=== TC TESTER

Work done at Karlsruhe conference, will have a post-conference review and level-set call.

=== TC VCARD

Set up call on the contact data model with FastMail participants, review charter. Need to adjust
rights for Date & Time.

== Plenary Meeting

Recommendation to Board of Directors to approve the new CalConnect Standards Directives and the
Partner Standards Development Organization.

TC DATETIME and TC LOCALIZATION approved; co-chairs at to develop Charters and submit to TCC.

== Confirmed Future Events

* Google will host CalConnect XLIV on February 4-8, 2019, in Zürich, Switzerland.
* You Can Book Me (YCBM) will host CalConnect XLV on June 3-7, 2019 in Bedford,
England.
* Possible interest by FastMail in hosting CalConnect XLVI in Autumn 2019 in
Philadelphia.
